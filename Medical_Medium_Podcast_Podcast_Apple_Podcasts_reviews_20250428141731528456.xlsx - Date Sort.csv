Magnificent Healer,SouthernGardener,12/29/2024,5 Stars,After 20+ years on my healing journey I found Anthony Williams.

optimal health,celery every day,04/27/2024,5 Stars,Best thing i ever have done for my health.!!No more guessing. I‚Äôve been implementing MM protocols for over 5 years. My health and energy is better than ever. I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening to me over the years. All those symptoms gone. I started with celery juice and heavy metal detox smoothie! Incorporating supplements and protocols. Just amazing results. So many haters out there just remember to experience for yourself. So fortunate to have Anthony dedicate his life to helping us all heal. We all deserve HEALTH!!
Best show ever empowering,kellyzara,04/10/2024,5 Stars,Anthony william saved my life four years ago. I prayed to the angels for help when I was dealing with chronic illness and fatigue. I had long haul covid in march 2020 and I desperately wanted to get better so I could keep up with my children. He gave me my life back with his incredible knowledge of celery juice and smoothie recipes. My energy came back instantly and I was able to start healing. If I hadn‚Äôt discovered this method I probably would not be alive today.
Medical Medium Podcast,Ben_Coe,03/27/2024,5 Stars,"Words cannot express these impact these living words had on my life already.

I‚Äôm a believer and a survivor,luvcrystalgazing,02/25/2024,5 Stars,"I give Anthony a 5 star. I‚Äôm 74 year old grandmother. Had a heart attack like 4 years ago. My last yearly checkup with my heart doctor. My results came back excellent. He said your heart is normal. His first question was. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing‚Äù. I told him I was eating healthy. Fruits and vegetables. Staying away from sugar. bread. eggs. Pasta etc. He told me ‚Äúwhatever your doing. Don‚Äôt change a thing. ‚Äú He took me off all the medications. Couple days later. I was sitting around. With a big smile on my face. Thinking about my office visit. I thought darn. I forgot to tell him. The most important thing. That I had been celery juicing each morning for approximately 6 months. Can‚Äôt believe that I forgot  after juicing. It had a big impact how good I felt. I owe this to Anthony‚Äôs knowledge. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about him. I‚Äôm so grateful. I bought a nice juicer. But when I could afford the Omega 1500 juicer. I bought one. It‚Äôs a great juicer and quiet. I only can tell my story. How it has effected me. I feel pretty good. I do take some of the VIMERGY vitamins liquid and capsules. Don‚Äôt take all that I‚Äôd like. As we know, we do what we can. Before I found Anthony. I was sick and searching for a healthy way of living. That‚Äôs when I found Anthony. As my favorite teacher. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer stated. ‚ÄúWhen the student is ready, the teacher will appear. It hit me. Dr. Dyer had mentioned Anthony in his podcast or his radio program. Referring him. Bingo the teacher appeared."
043 Healing Tools,Jodilynn‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢,02/18/2024,5 Stars,"This helped me so much. It gave me hope and comfort especially when I think of my future self. My brain does unfortunately tend to go back into fear mode from time to time when I think of 2 things:

1) I received 2 terrible medical treatments back in 2021. My soul made the wrong choice and I have to now live with that. Do the healing tools apply even to someone like me? I often wonder if I‚Äôm beyond repair because my DNA is now altered and who knows what else will happen to my body because of these non regulated treatments . 

2) I have healed many conditions already including trigger thumb, acne, SIBO, UTIs, and others while on MM protocols for over 4 years. Still working on headaches but even worse than that is back pain. X-rays show lots of stuff gone wrong with my back including regenerative discs, bulging discs, stinosis , etc. Is there hope for me with my back? It‚Äôs hard for me to know that the pain will improve. I know my brain needs to know this. I will work on it. 

I love you MM!!! Thank you and SOC for giving me and others a chance at a happy and joyful life! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Love,
Jodi"
A mental terrorist,CRWDtalk,02/23/2024,1 Star,The ‚Äúmedical medium‚Äù is a conspiracy troll who prays on people. His hypocrisy and lack of humanity is beyond comprehension. Please do not support
Meditations,Macika144,02/04/2024,5 Stars,"I recommend for everyone to listen to each episode multiple times as they are so informative, engaging and helpful. I love the guided meditations before bed. During the meditations, I always set the timer to the end of the episode since they are so relaxing and I fall asleep before they are done."
life changing advice‚Ä¶A Blessing,SaraBarnhart,02/02/2024,5 Stars,"MM improved my health and quality of life starting with celery juice.
After one month of celery juice, my labs changed for the better.
To this day, people ask me what I‚Äôm doing, what my health regimen is, because they see the difference in my energy level and appearance.
Thank You MM.

I heard the recent podcast about the haters, and anyone who doesn‚Äôt see a doctor when they get sick cannot blame anyone but themselves.

MM advice drastically improved my life, but I still see my doctor for checkups, and I get sick sometimes because I don‚Äôt follow everything perfectly, plus genetics and flu season‚Ä¶"
My soul connects with this Information üïäÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,Adriana Holmes,01/29/2024,5 Stars,"I love the podcasts!  It can be difficult to set time aside to read the books so getting this info in while multi tasking is helpful.  I find AW to bring me peace listening to him.  He motivates me to continue and reminds me every show that, I CAN heal! It reminds me of where I came from and that was a dark place.  I used to be addicted to food, drugs and caffeine.  I live a completely sober life now and happily so.  People are shocked when they find out that I don‚Äôt use any caffeine and workout at 6 am.  I‚Äôve healed acne, irregular periods, overactive bladder, migraines, lymphedema, hair loss, heart palpitations, CFS, PCOS, and I haven‚Äôt been sick in over 2 years!"
Anthony Williams‚Äôs mission is to save lives and that‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs doing,Sianna Lyons,01/25/2024,5 Stars,"I speak from my own experience, and from the experience of those for whom I‚Äôve implemented Medical Medium protocols, when I say that Anthony Williams has precious, factual, vital healing information for anyone suffering from chronic illness. Just because the mainstream medical community is either spiritually void or lacking in the imagination to comprehend that some people can communicate with spirit, Anthony William has been unfairly ostracized, despite the fact that he has had MDs calling him to do patient consultations for upwards of 30 years‚Ä¶and even though his information is healing more people around the globe than any other modality, in fact, more than all other modalities combined. The medical research community, however, has no problem poaching his information and claiming it as their own, for eg when Harvard scientists published a paper on Epstein Barr being a causative factor in multiple sclerosis in 2022. Anthony William write about that over a decade agio and has been teaching people for DECADES about EBV being behind MS and every other known chronic ‚Äúmystery illness‚Äù.Some day I believe AW will have to be acknowledged by all as the incredible healing medium that he is because millions of people around the world continue to heal using his protocols and his information will continue to be proven by future research. I‚Äôm just grateful that I have the common sense and spiritual understanding to accept that he gets his info from clairaudience, or hearing spirit."

holy messages of the light,naomi_viveka,06/29/2023,5 Stars,"Anthony William is a true messenger of God. If you want to know for yourself, read his first book, Medical Medium. (You can check it out from you local library if you don‚Äôt want to buy it.) His podcast has so much life-saving and healing information in every episode. I have listened to almost every podcast episode at least once. I‚Äôm using medical medium information to heal depression, anxiety, paranoia, ptsd, heart palpitations, fibromyalgia, neurological fatigue, chronic mystery nausea, severe abdominal pain, and many more symptoms. I have improved since implementing mm cleanses and customized mm tools for myself. I am functioning because of this information. And I have the faith, and physical evidence to know that I will take my healing all the way with medical medium information."
Prove it to yourself,TheJoyfulWarrior,05/06/2023,5 Stars,"I challenge anyone who criticizes the Medical Medium to try his recommendations for at least 30 days in a pure way.

There is absolutely No Way you would ever want to follow any other advice for food consumption - ever again. 

Not only that, but you will realize every word he says is either heaven sent, full of Compassion, or just really patient with the rest of us.

The Medical Medium is a gift of our time.

This guy needs to go to school‚Ä¶,Really though‚Ä¶,06/12/2023,1 Star,This person has no clear understanding of how the lymphatic system works or how the immune system in general works. This is really confusing and and this person speaks with authority when they don‚Äôt really have any clear understanding of basic biology and health. Extremely surprised by the popularity of this person.
Celery Cult,Jaycee_Regis,05/20/2023,1 Star,This show has all the signs of a cult leader preaching to the cult congregation. It‚Äôs terrible and not worth listening to u less you want to participate in a demonic sham.
This man is Amazing!,moreRoslyn,05/05/2023,5 Stars,I have followed Anthony william before his first book. He has helped me and my family. He is the most compassionate person I know and I‚Äôm so glad he is here to help others.
Word salad from a scammy cult leader,Krs10Delaney,05/02/2023,1 Star,This guy is a charlatan and a fraud.
Why do people believe him?,amesstewart,04/25/2023,1 Star,"There are people he is training claiming that histamine responses are the body detoxing. News flash, if celery juice is making your throat swell up and your body break out in hives, you are not detoxing you are having a histamine response. This guy is going to lead people off of a cliff. The last two episodes are so hyped up, redacted, this person is not humble, not questioning science. How are all of his followers skeptic of the healthcare industry and not of him? There is a history of people like him manipulating others and this is not ok. This is not an example of a healer. A true healer is humble. A true healer and true teacher would not be so intent on being sure they are given credit‚Ä¶how about checking you information, sir? You call it a plot I dont see you actually caring about anyone when you are lying and saying that a histamine response is the body detoxing. Someone can die from that. Are you aware? If you were a healer you would care. This is all so dangerous. People wake up and remember that 60% of people heal from placebo so the mind-body healing is real. Plant based organic foods are going to make a lot of health problems fall away, so is giving up all preservatives. There is nothing special that he has created except the idea that he created the health and wellness industry. Trying to make this whole conspiracy thing up‚Ä¶this is not how a healer behaves. This is so awful and harmful. Do not listen to him without a healthy amount of skepticism. He is not a good person."
Medical Media Protocols helped me heal from Endometriosis,jjnhyhyvrklk,04/24/2023,5 Stars,"Endometriosis is a sickness that every doctor tells you is not curable and that it can. only be treated and controlled but not curable.

I went to so many different Dr‚Äôs & healers of every community you can think of, western, eastern, naturopathic, holistic, nutritionist, acupuncturist, list & money went on & on. 
My Dr & PA in western & functional med monitored my wellness as I applied MM info 100% not just diet, his whole protocol that is much more than diet. I read his books & knew my healing path And I have proof in black & white his published information healed me. My Dr & PA were floored. They never saw this kind of healing or speed of healing. I healed significant things, including my kidney function, my pain, my CFS. It was amazing! Thank you I am eternally grateful.

MM Info saved my life‚Ä¶,amy9daLa,04/21/2023,5 Stars,"As I was about to start my rotations a decade ago, I had to leave medical school (in my 20s) as a result of developing a crippling mystery systemic illness. I spent 7-8 yrs almost entirely bedridden with cumulatively >100 symptoms and conditions. Life was tortuous and became overwhelmingly bleak overnight. I was living moment to moment most of the time, unable to breathe, triggered by everything, flat-lined by anything and everything, internally toxic and severely deficient. I received immunotherapy, etc., put on lots of meds. (which offered hosts of new problems) and was ultimately sent to a prominent clinic for care. No one had answers and not even sufficient labels for what was happening to me. I was put on even more (10-15) prescription drugs and was sent home weaker than ever before. I received care in both conventional and alternative medicine. I changed my diet multiple times.
 Unfortunately, I remained very sick, increasingly more toxic and deficient for years on end‚Ä¶that is, until I saw the very first MM book in 2019. Somehow, I had the strength to read it (mostly out loud‚Ä¶which was a miracle in and of itself). The information resonated so deeply, I sobbed while reading it. Note that I did have to leave behind my prior medical and science background to a degree to accept this information. That being said, it possesses an internal consistency not found in medicine. With all the support necessary, we began implementing MM healing tools and removing troublemaker foods that were feeding pathogens, chronically dehydrating me and acting as neurotoxic cold turkey (note: removing ALL corn permanently was SO hard for me, personally)!  I eventually read all of the books. Liver Rescue let me know that when I felt I couldn‚Äôt persevere, the Living Words would persevere for me and be the hands that would lift me up and allow me to keep going. I was tested for EBV. My titers for a ‚Äúprevious infection‚Äù were 20-30x higher than diagnostic levels. I was desperate to feel better, so I attempted to be militant with applying the information I was learning. I haven‚Äôt looked back since. I just focused on my progress every step of the way and got better and better over time. It only took 3 days to see a big change in me, so we knew the information for sure was the real deal (nothing else in alternative. I‚Äôve been healing the same way I suffered -moment to moment, hour to hour, and one day at a time. Today, I only consume the ‚ÄúHoly Four‚Äù foods.  I‚Äôve been working on my healing for >3.5 yrs and have used countless customizable MM healing tools and supplement protocols long-term/daily. I still have a ways to go but am already a new person. I feel I have been/ am being reborn. I have reversed most of what ailed me.  I have been off of ALL medication for 3.5 yrs (even OTC drugs). This information heals not only what‚Äôs physically wrong but also heals you at a soul and spiritual level. Anthony William is an angel walking this earth, selflessly working to help humanity every day of his life. It‚Äôs all a grassroots effort. He doesn‚Äôt sell anything - he even tells you to get his books at the library. Healing is not linear, not even a little. It has been and is very hard work and not for the faint of heart. It takes a very long time (especially if you‚Äôve been very sick long-term/all your life), but it is honestly the single most important work I know I could be doing. Now, I am also helping a number of others (volunteering) to heal while they learn the information for themselves and get out of the woods (and out of the Matrix). Even though today my life is nothing as I had planned or dreamed, I am eternally grateful to be here, to know how to truly cherish and care for my body, grateful to know the answers. I don‚Äôt have to fear illness anymore. This is THE one true path to healing and a lifetime of true vitality. Thank God for Anthony William, SoC and MM info. All my love to you, always."

Two of his episodes sounds like he‚Äôs talking to someone and it‚Äôs just confusing. Another of his episodes about anxiety, he‚Äôs just saying all the symptoms and not saying anything helpful. Talks about how mild and severe anxiety is but everything he‚Äôs saying are things that we already know. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the podcast at all and I tried 3 episodes and I just think it‚Äôs who he is.

Omg I have never had an answer before. This points me in the direction to heal. I found this by fate and I am confident it can help me find healing. This is the start to my journey to get past this. THANK YOU from all of my heart as I sit here in tears for sharing this! My goal is to try to get off these meds and get my health back. Thank you!"
Critical information,Mpmckellar,02/17/2023,5 Stars,Medical Medium saved my life!! These podcasts offer really important information and I especially love the meditations!
Lies lies lies,The Voyerguy,03/01/2023,1 Star,Claiming to speak to a spirit that gives medical advice to cure your ailments ? He's nothing more than a grifter. His content is full of erroneous content he labels as facts.
Quack,Swicord Family,02/28/2023,1 Star,"He believes that old airliners are used to spray chemicals all over the earth. No evidence. No witnesses. No invoices or receipts for such an expensive endeavor. Listen to such rubbish for entertainment, but take action on his meanderings at your peril."
Condescending and takes things to the extreme.,Filtz89,02/18/2023,1 Star,"The episode I listened to I couldn‚Äôt make it through more than 20 minutes. It‚Äôs obvious he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about and gives extremely dumb examples of the things that yes some people are doing, but it‚Äôs not the way it‚Äôs suggested to do.  Exaggeration and repetitive delivery style are a hard listen."
More Episodes please,PT assist/TK,02/12/2023,5 Stars,"These podcasts are really good! I have the books, but these are so convenient to listen to and re-listen to‚Ä¶.when you don‚Äôt have time to sit down and read a book."
Medical medium is saving us all,Raverstud,02/11/2023,5 Stars,"Two years ago I was introduced and I have moved forward is many leaps and bounds. Low carb, did it. High protein high fat did it. No fruit did it. Almost every podcast is my story. I was just about dead. No exaggeration. I was too I'll to even do most of these things and still can't handle some of the detoxes but after living on fruit and slowly introducing foods after being able to eat nothing   ( also not an exaggeration) I've come back. I am finally able to tolerate the celery juice and I'm going 6 months strong. Fruit is the answer. Every doctor is always pushing no fruit, low carb. Even the holistic or natural ones. This was truly what got me back on track to not just surviving but thriving. Everyday I'm stronger and some are still very hard but when I look back I see the huge improvements in my life. After being sick must of my life I'm 45. The road to recovery is very long but it exists. I tried everything people, doctors  natural and regular and everything in between. Ive been chasing good health for 30 years and nothing ever worked. Until now. Thank you Anthony and Spirit. Than you! I'm getting my life back and bring those around me too! ü•∞"
Please Make More,DayTripperJinnie,02/09/2023,5 Stars,"The only issue I have with this Podcast is that there aren‚Äôt more of them. I know Anthony is busy, but I would listen to these podcasts weekly if he made them. I enjoy all of them!"
My favorite podcast,Sasa Peace,01/23/2023,5 Stars,"I love this healing information, especially the breathing light meditation. I listen to the breathing light meditation everyday. It healed my anxiety. I listen every morning when I wake up. It‚Äôs a great way to start the day. Thanks so much!!"

Help for the lost,Ginginmama,12/14/2022,5 Stars,The podcasts and Medical Medium books have saved my life.

From Hopeless to Healed ‚ú®ü§ç,Jackie_B.,12/07/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony William is a messenger of truth in an ocean of deceit and confusion. The information he delivers on these Podcasts always sets the record straight. You are never left without clarity or closure, and the messages are always consistent. 

After 11 years of suffering, lost hope, and defeat, I have finally found answers and am taking my life back one step at a time. Future generations will heal because of Anthony and the information he spends his life delivering. I am forever grateful for AW and SOC!"
Greatest Prophet of our times,HealedByMM,11/27/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony William brings divine information to humanity in order to heal the epidemic of chronic illness sweeping our planet. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Anthony‚Äôs protocols from Spirit of Compassion not only heal the physical body, they are a healing balm for the soul and a revitalizing elixir for the spirit. 

When you endeavor on medical medium protocols (and there are many that are all customizable- no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù here) you not only begin a journey to heal chronic illness, you walk the path of healing body, heart, mind, soul and spirit. 

If the millions of rave reviews and healing stories of people around the world don‚Äôt shake you and wake you up to the fact that there is something real, powerful, and truthful here, how about this: it works. It‚Äôs the only set of chronic illness protocols that are actually ERADICATING chronic illness around the globe. The medicine/pills/shots/therapies out there now are meant to manage- pain management, symptom suppression for a short period of time until it gets worse then more pills, more shots, more more more. All the while, never knowing- ‚Äúwhat is the root cause in the first place??‚Äù

Medical medium information gets to the heart of the problem and eradicates trouble makers causing Illness. 

Do yourself a favor and listen to this man. Your life may very well depend upon it."
Could be boiled down to a 5 minute episode,a mom2,12/03/2022,1 Star,I find the inane rambling of this podcast absolutely maddening. Get to the point. There may be some good advice buried in these episodes but I won‚Äôt waste hours of my time listening to it to find out.
Thank you God for healing üôåüèº,VibrantMariah,11/25/2022,5 Stars,I admire Anthony Williams hard work to bring us the truth and that isn‚Äôt easy but with faith all things are possible even healing.

AW you are my angle!,F. Dean,11/23/2022,5 Stars,"Thank you for all the truths that you are gifting us! Love each and every one of your podcasts, books, and shows."
Finally connected the dots,TBWB,11/12/2022,5 Stars,I found Anthony William (Medical Medium) when I was looking for a natural way to cure Lyme disease after I was told to go on more rounds of several antibiotics for it. I started reading online about him and listening to his podcasts and podcasts where he was a guest and everything started to connect and makes sense to me. It literally was finding the missing piece of the puzzle in regards to my health. Everything he talked about was like he was talking directly to me and what I was experiencing. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Highly recommend listening to his podcasts and reading his books for answers to your health problems. So blessed to have found him.
So grateful to know about Anthony while on my intense healing road,Grandmasqueen,11/10/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony, thank you, I‚Äôm learning so much from your books, podcasts, videos. I am the definition of so much that you teach about. Just listened to the anxiety podcast & feeling hopeful that I can & will heal. Thank you."
Thank you!!!,Natasha 86,11/07/2022,5 Stars,I think your episode about anxiety might just save my life. Thank you.
It works!!,DiannaRostad,11/06/2022,5 Stars,"I own all his books and consult them like dictionaries, because IT WORKS! I give the books as gifts and send them to sick friends. I wish I had known about Medical Medium when my daughter Jessica was sick with cancer :-( 

Thank you, AW & SOC"
Whoever gave 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è they are trolls!,arroz con frijoles,11/05/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony William is real and true! His podcast has not only educated me immensely but has given me the information to heal my chronic illness. I was suffering with migraines, ear pain, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain, jaw pain, for years and was dismissed by the medical industry. Nothing relieved my suffering until I listened to MM and implemented his teachings. Unfortunately, the Medical Field is out to get him because he only speaks the truth and makes them look bad. Thank you Anthony William for your gifts that you have shared with all of us! May God bless you!‚úùÔ∏è"

Truth at Last,Sherp 2013,10/22/2022,5 Stars,"I practiced as a clinical dietitian for 20 years, kept my registration status (meaning an evaluation process, a plan of study, executing that plan and submitting proof of comprehension for 75 board approved credits every 5 yrs) for an additional decade. This man‚Äôs information is accurate in terms of what we know scientifically, and yet it also goes far beyond our current theories regarding chronic and mystery illness, to the truth. And I know it‚Äôs the truth because I‚Äôve tried it myself and discovered that it works. I‚Äôm a scientist. But I‚Äôm not so closed minded that I won‚Äôt try something completely harmless to see if it helps. Some have remarked that they do not like his unpolished delivery nor his repetition. I like both. A healing remedy need not be delivered on a golden tray. A plain glass plate suits me. From the first time I heard Anthony, in answer to a prayer after my husband‚Äôs trial with stage 4 lung cancer and consequent death, his words rang true. His first book came out a month later and I scrutinized it with the skeptical eye of a decades long conventional medical practitioner. Science has debunked nothing of what this man has asserted. Anyone I know of from my own life or have heard of through social media, who follows Anthony‚Äôs advice, has benefited from it. And many who previously suffered with a host of ailments have healed from them when conventional medicine failed them. Just take a look in the beginning of his books, at the list of esteemed doctors, other health practitioners, scientists, elite athletes and their coaches, and others at the top of their fields who endorse his work. After my decades long career as a clinical dietitian, I earned my masters degree in special education and practiced as a special ed teacher for students on both ends of the spectrum; the learning disabled and the highly gifted. The repetition some struggle with in Anthony‚Äôs presentations is one of the best ways for us to truly learn. It takes patience to hear something over and over but the benefits are well worth the effort. Was 57 when my husband died and didn‚Äôt know if I could physically and emotionally go on after being his caregiver right to the bitter end and then losing him. Immediately upon following Anthony‚Äôs recommendations my life turned around and I got progressively better day by day. And now, three years later at 60 I‚Äôm filled with more energy and strength than I had before his sickness. Old injuries that I never thought it possible, have healed. I look and feel younger and I feel as though I can face anything. The angels he teaches us to call upon have been a source of great strength, wisdom and healing as well. I treasure the spiritual aspects of his information as much as any other part. Anthony William/Medical Medium is a blessing and an arm of God. I will always be very deeply grateful to him."

AW fills in the missing facts needed to understand health,JD-BuyItRight,09/29/2022,5 Stars,"I found it is best to read the books and to listen to the podcasts. It helped me commit to go all in. I needed this comitment to help me let go some of my favorite foods and snacks. (That I was addicted to)

Anthony Williams (AW) speaks from the heart. His delivery can sometimes be a bit long winded, especially the older podcasts‚Ä¶ However, he is the only person on the planet speaking up in a non-selfish way about the connection between what we eat and how/why it affects us. 

I can tell u from personal experience that dabbling does not work. Eating one healthy food does not cancel one negative food. 

It is best to Stop Feeding the Viruses by replacing virus feeding foods with healing foods. The faster the virus feeding foods are removed, the faster the positive results. 

If you can go all in for 6 months, the better the results. I found it best for me to enroll a friend and make these changes together.

Thank you Anthony for helping me understand the problem so I could fix it and get my energy back!"
Intermittent Fasting,odysseyinstead,10/01/2022,1 Star,Completely uninformed. Stupid. First and last time I‚Äôll listen.
Great info weird delivery,nmezic87,09/27/2022,5 Stars,"I love Anthony William and truly believe he is the real deal. His last podcast about aliens, cryptics and the origin of humanity was fascinating and unlike anything I've ever heard before! MORE PLEASE!!!!!"
Truth bombs,kappel333,09/27/2022,5 Stars,"No more living with your eyes closed, going through life without knowing the truth about health, our world, even our universe. Anthony Williams is at your service in these podcasts. They are all worth listening to, especially if you are sick."

I‚Äôve been following him last several years and my health and my family‚Äôs health can‚Äôt be better than now. There are so many health & food related information- too much to choose from.

True Healing,cleansing to heal,09/12/2022,5 Stars,Until I found a Medical Medium I was searching high and low for the answers to heal my Mystery symptoms and illnesses. Doctors had no solutions only medication Band-Aids. Anthony William and spirit of compassion share true healing methods. I am no longer searching for the answers because I know that I have found them.
Life-saving information!,seasoned and healing,09/06/2022,5 Stars,"The information in these podcasts  is critical for everyone to know in order to thrive on this planet. With the truths that Anthony provides, the chronically Ill can stop going from doctor to doctor searching for answers while falling into trendy traps and finally get down to healing the source of the problem. I am so grateful to Anthony and to Spirit of Compassion for giving us these truths which finally got me on the path to healing after struggling with no answers for 11 years. I enjoy how he adds some lighthearted humor into these podcasts while  providing us the critical truths we need to know! The meditations have brought peace to my soul and helped me through some difficult times."
Fake News,"Colleen, son.",09/11/2022,1 Star,"There's a lot of people here denouncing AW's work as ""fake"" who are paid by the government

Lots of people have healed including ""autoimmune"". Those gene therapy is a scam. High protein is a scam. Tuning to his content whether here, YT or IG, you will learn A LOT."
Hack Fraud Lying to sell Stuff,KevinsnSuzies,09/06/2022,1 Star,"There is absolutely zero evidence this man gives credible scientific or medical advice. He is a grifter, a liar, and completely full of crap hucking his celery juice cure. Anthony William is a human parasite."
mind blown,05221998,09/06/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony's info is the only source of health, healing, & any info i trust. His info is continuously proven right & i can't wait for more to come! The meditations actually work, you feel the difference right away, i'm always still mind blown!"

Healing from Occipital Neuralgia.,Rachel Lightbrush,08/26/2022,5 Stars,"I really love this kind of food and have almost  no desire or cravings for food that is bad for me.  
This is very slow but sure healing for me as the flares have been less frequent and including this last one, not nearly as severe. My day and night non stop headache lasted for  months and exhausted me, but last time didn‚Äôt have the typical electric shocks every 20 to 30 seconds, like full blown occipital neuralgia.
 I am so  different in between flares, when I feel very young and energetic and I am 76.  All my joints and organs etc seem to be fine. And I am on no meds. When I go for a check up and fill out a form I have nothing to declare.
I have been told from friends who have more experience with MM that the last phases of die off with the viruses such as shingles can be the most difficult. Shingles can cause ON. So I am saying this to myself and others who could get discouraged when symptoms return. 
Pharmaceuticals have never been for me so I love this way of healing and have great faith that I am going to finally going to be done with pain altogether.  I love the kindness of Anthony. And the support from the Medical Medium community.
Honey is so good and healthy for me and I have much gratitude for the bees. We have created a two acre wildflower field with mowed paths so we all can enjoy the beauty of butterflies, bees and flowers. Our garden especially the herb and flower garden is shared by many."
Annoying but Honest,apnwmom,08/31/2022,2 Stars,"I wish Anthony would get to the point. These episodes could be cut 75%. The rambling and repeating himself is so annoying! Please just deliver the facts! I gave two stars because I believe all of his information, he speaks truth!"
Too long and rambling,terriw1117,08/28/2022,1 Star,There are some nuggets of good information in here but it takes him too long to get to it and some of the stories are ridiculous and not even really related to the podcast. Can‚Äôt listen any longer.
Medical medium saves lives,mare~,08/26/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony William has dedicated his entire life to help the unwell rise up out of the ashes. His information is divine.

So helpful,heartfocusedhealing,08/24/2022,5 Stars,"The Medical Medium information is wonderfully nuanced and it just makes sense. It‚Äôs so helpful to understand how things have gotten completely distorted in the mainstream. Such as‚Ä¶ how did foods like banana, potato, avocado and honey become the enemy, yet unproductive and dangerous health trends (radical fat diet) are widely accepted? This is information you‚Äôre not going to hear elsewhere and it just might save your life!"

Great info but needlessly long to get the info,suziemilano,08/21/2022,4 Stars,"So far I love Anthony‚Äôs work and information. I am curious about alot of things and want to listen to the podcasts but they are, in my opinion, way too long with too many side info to fill up time that isn‚Äôt actually helpful.  Alot of examples of life scenarios are used or analogies and I would prefer a shorter introduction and to get the point of what we need to know. I prefer the books at this point."
Helpful for all areas in life,Never Pay Retail,08/18/2022,5 Stars,"Listening to each of these podcasts here are proving to be truly helpful in my health improvements. It‚Äôs wow. How can just listening to a podcast be so helpful to me in my healing and health journey?! It‚Äôs like knowing what‚Äôs going on that‚Äôs causing health declines is critical to know. I‚Äôve made many small and big adjustments in my daily routines. Now I see many quick little improvements and some Big health improvements since making these adjustments posed here by Anthony William. This has helped more than reading health journals and articles. With all the small and big improvements, I feel and believe I can heal. I‚Äôm not all the way better, I mean. But the improvements are to much and too big for me to ignore. Thank you Anthony for sharing your gift with people you don‚Äôt know or will ever meet. I mean, there‚Äôs nothing you really get from me but maybe a review and my gratitude.

Life changing information,nelsoulbeautiful,08/10/2022,5 Stars,"This podcast is EVERYTHING you didn‚Äôt know you need in life but absolutely do. I was 25 when my health started to decline rapidly. Eventually, one symptom led to another and before I could even get an handle on things I was overwhelmed with 30 plus symptoms. The plans I had at that time were completely derailed. Anthony and SOC information was the answer to my prayers. Listening to Anthony is like having that good friend you can call on for the best, most wise, well rounded, and sound advice. I‚Äôve watched my life and many of those around me transform with the helpful tools found in the MM book series, website, podcast, etc. You no longer have to navigate the cess pool of ‚Äúhealth‚Äù information found out there in the mainstream. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt even call this a heath, wellness, or lifestyle podcast- it‚Äôs so much greater."

It brings tears to my eyes when I look back and realize this information not only saved my life but likely has saved my soul. This is a light at the end of a long dark tunnel. This new series is even more advanced than what he‚Äôs already shared. Listen to the Chemtrails episode, even if you think you know about chemtrails, play it over and over again, and be blown away with each hidden gem of spiritual truth. And then experience the Breathing Light Meditation ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a spiritual healing from the Holy Spirit that builds on itself over time. I was sobbing out of the gate üò≠üôèüèª No word is wasted. Truth is power. In great gratitude. üôèüèª"
Healing Journey,Laura Badger,07/20/2022,5 Stars,"Anthony has taught me how to eat to heal. I have been able to move the needle on over a dozen symptoms that no other person has been able to move. It takes perseverance and bravery to change eating habits, but the journey is eye-opening and actually works. I see this world so differently with MM in my life and can confidently say I hold the power to my healing! In a world where information is endless, the quality of this information is priceless. Thank you AW and SoC."
Unfortunately not worth the listen,CS1463,07/23/2022,2 Stars,"I have all of the Medical Mediums books and I‚Äôm always eager to see what new information he comes out with. However, unfortunately, his podcast leaves much to be desired. The amount of information actually provided could fit into a 10 minute segment. Most of this hour long podcast is fear baiting, theatrics, and odd and grossly inaccurate assumptions of how ‚Äúwe feel about ourselves‚Äù or conversations we‚Äôve supposedly had with ourselves and our healthcare providers. It‚Äôs too much. I tried so hard to listen, but after 4 episodes of him droning on and on and me rolling my eyes every other sentence and barely getting anything of use out of it, I had to move on. I‚Äôll gladly keep taking his health advice, but via his well written and to the point books and Instagram posts."
Lifesaving Love from Above,"Healing my Mind, Body and Soul",07/19/2022,5 Stars,"I am eternally grateful to God and Anthony William for sharing the MM information with the world.  MM is saving my life among the many hundreds of thousands of others who have been fortunate to find this also! Please listen closely.

THE TRUTH SHALL HEAL YOU & SET YOU FREE!,Noell Bulka,07/15/2022,5 Stars,"MM, aka, Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion have changed my life. I am healing and walking bc of their incredible medical and spiritual awakening information. You cannot find this information anywhere. After years of multiple narcotic drugs and steroids and 3 back surgeries nothing could take the pain away. I have healed over 20 symptoms through a high raw plant based lifestyle with Vimergy supplements and healing herbal teas. The biggest change was my emotional and spiritual not just physical. I feel like a Phoenix rising out of the ashes of darkness and knowing who I am truly am and my place in the world. They brought me back to God and now I AM an Initiate. The medical industry prescribes bandaids and no solutions of healing to the chronically ill. Medical Medium and Spirit of Compassion provides a special Trinity (emotional, physical and spiritual) life healing roadmap. Thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me my life back! God bless you! These podcasts are the real truth and it is time for mankind to awaken! Know you CAN and WILL heal! Have faith and call the angel devas in to help you. This critical healing information is the world‚Äôs blessing. Forever grateful and full of love and Divine Compassion for you all. God bless you Anthony for sacrificing your life to the service of man and BEING such a loving and beautiful soul. üôè"

Finally a compassionate truth teller!,alxrco,07/01/2022,5 Stars,For those giving one star ratings I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre sick enough to appreciate AW‚Äôs information.

"Good info, but it is like pulling teeth to get to it‚Ä¶",HJBAK,07/10/2022,2 Stars,"The info is excellent! But why doesn‚Äôt someone edit this and get to the point without torturing us. This goes on and on, and tries to be theatrical, to no avail. I have read some of his books and followed the protocols. I got excellent results! But cannot stand to listen to Anthony. He just repeats himself and assumes we are all not very smart. Anyways, he has great material, just wish someone edited for him and made this easier to listen to.."

Super thankful for this truth speaker,Daimoku speed Diva,05/01/2022,5 Stars,"10+ STARS!!!!!!!!!!!  Word of mouth is how I discovered AW and only because my friend was persistent in urging me to get with the program did I get to see for myself how truly amazing Medical Medium wisdom is.  

Even on a meager income, I manage to make it work with all the shopping for fresh produce, food prepping, stocking, meal prepping and inventory management. 

 If I wasn‚Äôt totally convinced of the efficacy of the protocols, I couldn‚Äôt find creative ways to make a way out of no way on such a modest budget.  Knowing the root causes behind mystery illnesses is worth more than gold!  I can‚Äôt rave enough about how awesome Medical Medium wisdom is!!!! 

Crying tears of joy for being told the truth of why I‚Äôm chronically unwell and how to finally heal!  Been practicing in earnest for almost 6 months and notice remarkable improvements in health.  Have quite a long journey but that‚Äôs perfectly fine because I‚Äôm on the right road!"
A gift from the heavens,pinket,04/26/2022,5 Stars,I am pretty new here and I am in awe of how much I have learned and applied to my life. I am grateful to Anthony and SOC for loving us so much.

Such a fascinating Podcast,tmmgr,03/16/2022,5 Stars,"I have been listening and everything is really resonating with me. Thank you for this information, I just had a baby and was very thankful to find out I should avoid chocolate during my pregnancy. I also had a healthy pregnancy drinking celery juice."
Wow,lina.ava,02/26/2022,5 Stars,"Loved the pod cast , I‚Äôm glad god brought me here to listen. I really enjoyed the celery juice episode."
Unfounded Conspiracy Theorist,HannaHapoo,02/27/2022,1 Star,"As a Registered Nurse I like to explore all different kinds of healing modalities like alternative medicine etc to incorporate into my practice. After listening to one podcast for only 15 minutes I quickly identified that in the midst of some accurate information was a bunch of misinformation and conspiracies about ‚Äúthe industry,‚Äù designed to make us sick by releasing viruses made by egg protein and that it‚Äôs a huge secret! We all know that vaccines are created using egg embryos because thats a livable habitat for viruses! And guess what!? Vaccines are responsible for making viruses less virulent and less transmissible therefore decreasing the impact it has on human health. Also sometimes vaccines are FREE so it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why would an industry create viruses knowing that another ‚Äúindustry‚Äù is shelling out millions of dollars to combat viruses FREE to the public, ultimately impacting the economy of EVERYONE living in that country. I will tell you that a lot of industries make a ton of money off of people who make or are forced to make unhealthy life style choices. So why don‚Äôt you talk about the food industry and link with obesity/heart disease and diabetes, pharmaceutical industry, oil industry, cosmetic industry and the list goes on. These are the real industries capitalizing on and contributing to human illness."
Anthony and Spirit are life savers,Donniethompson,02/10/2022,5 Stars,"Medical Medium information is not a fad or trend. If you learn the information and apply it correctly you can heal no matter what you have been through. Don‚Äôt cheat yourself out of healing. Take it one day at a time. Any little thing you do for your health is powerful! Take it from someone that searched high and low for answers for crippling depression, anxiety, acne, dermatitis, and skin rashes. This stuff works! I no longer have panic attacks and am able to get out of bed in the morning and feel excited and full of peace and happiness for the day ahead. My skin is healing and I look and feel more youthful than ever before! Anthony and spirit are a shining light in this world and I am so grateful to have found their information.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
AW is the real thing!,EJB517,01/22/2022,5 Stars,AW and SOC (sprit of compassion) are just lights on this earth helping the chronically ill and not so chronically ill which is what I consider myself to be. I have low grade symptoms and started following AW after a year and a half of not getting pregnant. I have had many supervising things happens since implementing his protocols. I‚Äôm not perfect with it and am still healing but he is AMAZING!
Blown Away in a good way!,spunky_sightseer,01/10/2022,5 Stars,I learned so much about some of the chronic issues I have. This information is powerful. I am so thankful I found Medical Medium. These podcast episodes are a true awakening. It made sense when my allergy food test came back as being allergic to garlic and grapefruit. Anthony explains it perfect. Now I understand why the test reports I was allergic. At the tim I didn't know I had an overload of strep and mold in my system. But I was eating garlic and grapefruits daily. I'm thankful I kept eating garlic instead of listen to my naturopathic doc who recommended I stay away for garlic for a few months.
So grateful,jayanti treeman,12/29/2021,5 Stars,"Thank you Anthony and socü•∞what a blessing you are in my life and on this earth at this time !!wow not sure what I‚Äôd do had I not found u and read your first book.

I share your information with all my friends and loved ones and can‚Äôt thank u enough for all that you do. I get it! I see u!! I‚Äôm here with u all the way. Love u sooo sooo much and hope to meet u in person some day. I have a dream of creating a farm and retreat center where people could come and cleanse and heal with your protocols with fruits, vegetables and herb right from the farm. I want to continue healing and promoting your work for the rest of my life absolutely"
I listen to AW everyday!,Lili corazon 7890,12/20/2021,5 Stars,"This is the most valuable information that you can get a hold of and take into your advantage. The podcast, the books and the recipes have changed me as a whole. Thank you AW and THANK YOU Spirit of Compassion."
"Good info, wish there was more of it",JacquiKP22222222,12/24/2021,4 Stars,"The info is definitely different, and when trying out the liver cleansing recommendations for my skin and mood issues, I do find that I am feeling a bit better and will continue. However, I feel like the show is just so much fluff with so much appealing to the listener, critiquing modern medicine, and promising to give more information in other shows or redirecting the listener to the book that I am left feeling it is not very worth it to listen to the show. I wish there was a focus more in-depth information on the ‚Äúwhy and how‚Äù of both the workings of the body and how to actually eat and follow the protocols. It feels mostly like a teaser to advertise for the books if I‚Äôm being honest, but again don‚Äôt want to give it a low rating because I think the info might me helpful."
"Hearing truths for the first time hits your heart emotionally, spiritually, and physically.",itsmetam2018,12/18/2021,5 Stars,"This information is a gift from above. I cried the first time I read Thyroid Healing because it addressed every question I had that none of my Doctors could answer. I never accepted what Drs said about my body attacking itself. I wanted and demanded root causes which none of them were trained to find or address. 

Tests after tests, too many blood draws to count and the only answers they gave me were; its in your head, you look fine, you need a hysterectomy, we‚Äôre going to have to remove your thyroid, you can‚Äôt heal this on your own, medications for life and the breathing issues and physical exhaustion must be stress and anxiety, take medications etc. Aches, pains and so much more I was suffering and no one could help until I found Anthony Williams Books. (I didn‚Äôt take any of the Dr‚Äôs advice).

I now own all of his Books and they‚Äôre changing my life. I‚Äôm soaking up all the information like a sponge and I‚Äôm soooo grateful for this information from AW, SOC and all of the support communities assisting one another with Q&A‚Äôs all for free. I want to shout this information from the rooftops and wish the world would instantly have this information to save themselves and their loved ones from any/all health symptoms or chronic illnesses, etc.

I‚Äôve been on it now for a little over 3.5 months and my energy and breathing are back to normal, I no longer think about my breathing because it comes naturally again now. I literally felt before like I was dying because I couldn‚Äôt breathe well, ran out of breath and all tests said I was fine. 

My thyroid nodules shrank about 50% in size and I had a lot of them, 6 big ones! I haven‚Äôt retested for anything because I had so many tests and xrays, MRI‚Äôs, CT Scans, bloodwork done and AW explains how bad these tests are for you so right now I‚Äôm feeling great and am gauging it by how I feel. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and look amazing again, my face rash is getting some improvements, and a lot more improvements.

Some people dis his Books because he talks to spirt to get the information. To me I think that‚Äôs the coolest part, the information is love, pure love, its a gift. Besides those nah sayers haven‚Äôt been through a chronic illnesses where they felt left behind by Doctors with no help whatsoever. And if you read the Bible it talks about spirits all the time. So sadly some people don‚Äôt believe in what they can‚Äôt see on this planet but they should keep their dark negative opinions to themselves and let the information help those that really need it. 

Thank you God for this information! Happy Healing everyone, you can do it with these books."
Changed my health,AKM in California,11/11/2021,5 Stars,"I read Medical Medium in 2019 and started on the celery juice just to see what would happen. After 1 month, the persistent eczema on my hands was gone. After 2 months, the hot flashes were gone. After 3 months, the cystic acne around my mouth was gone. Now, two years later, the low back pain is also gone, the tonsil stones are gone, I‚Äôm almost down to my ideal weight and my sleep, focus, and energy level are loads better. This is the real deal. Read the books first, then listen to the podcasts for information about specific topics. Life changing."

"Healing is possible, when you are ready",Jenny Lloyd Wolter,10/08/2021,5 Stars,"Anthony William is a gift from god, his healing words have saved my life and I intend to pass these gifts down to my son to help him navigate this increasingly difficult world. I do his various meditation every night and listen to his older podcasts and radio show for key tips that have helped me healing my debilitating chronic illnesses. I follow him on social media, read his books with gems of insight in them, and these podcasts round out my healing journey. I trust what he says. I didn‚Äôt at first but after following his advice for years I now do, because it works. Even if you don‚Äôt believe (or don‚Äôt want to believe), he is here for you when you are ready - many come to him desperate for answers after trying so many things that haven‚Äôt worked. It‚Äôs almost like you need to be desperate to actually make these difficult changes to your life. When you do, you will not be disappointed - nor alone. The medical medium community is loving and compassionate and here for you when you decide to join. Much love to AW, may the Angel of Mercy keep him safe and the Angle of Light forever shine a bright path for him. Thank you spirit of compassion for choosing AW to help us safe ourselves.

"Rambles, goes and on and on, too much fluff",Br20s,09/26/2021,1 Star,"I listen to his audiobook cleanse to heal. I haven‚Äôt tried his protocol yet, it‚Äôs confusing. Anthony just please get to the point!!! I think you could make your podcast 30 minutes, definitely  not more than an hour. You don‚Äôt have to say in every episode who has 20-30yrs, if you do, just say and don‚Äôt keep going on and on about it. Same with how you were 4 when you diagnosed your grandma. Don‚Äôt say how you don‚Äôt care about money, that you aren‚Äôt trying to sell supplements like some people. Yet you are always promoting some other non related to the topic, one of your books. His podcasts does basically just say what he has already said in his book cleanse to heal too. I have such a hard time listening to his episodes because I get so annoyed! And no, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs disrespectful for doctors to think that you are being ridiculous that they went to school for years yet you didn‚Äôt for health. That makes no sense! For him to be offended, even if his info is right"
the real deal,hannygus,09/23/2021,5 Stars,"I get why some people might not like the podcast. It‚Äôs a little weird.. and if you don‚Äôt know his background info it might shock you. HOWEVER, I am beyond grateful to MM for his information. READ HIS BOOKS! Start with the first one. I‚Äôm 26 and have suffered from chronic illness my entire life. Been to dozens of doctors of all kinds. Had over a hundred different tests done. And things kept getting worse until I found MM. I was desperate, hooked on prescriptions that were only making my conditions worse. I‚Äôm over a year into following his protocols and have never felt so good. I have more energy than I did even as a child. My physical symptoms as well as anxiety and depression have drastically improved. All around, my life has gotten better and better while applying his info. Be aware, it gets harder before it gets better. Look for him on Insta and find a health coach there who uses his protocols to help you through the journey."
Medical Medium is Fabulous- thank you!,debbggkk,08/26/2021,5 Stars,Thank you for saving my daughters and I lives. I really would be in bad shape of it was not for you. You are a real gift from God.
Sorry to be the Fly in the ointment,dapperdude7,09/05/2021,1 Star,"Well, it may be unfair to rate a podcast after only listening to one episode, but it‚Äôs an hour I will never get back in my life. And it was wasted on a man who sounded like a charlatan pretty quickly, at least to me.

I went to the eye health podcast since I am trying to learn as much about the eye as possible. And I was hoping to get new info here. 

Here‚Äôs a little clue for me : when somebody is so sure of the answers to questions that are undecided and difficult, such as questions about the eye and vision, very complex systems, you might ask how is it he has the answers.

And when said person claims it‚Äôs from ‚Äúspirit light‚Äù , basically god talking to this man and revealing the ‚Äútruth‚Äù, I only continued listening for amusement.

Ahhhhh‚Ä¶..but he also has a BOOK to sell offering these answers, and books that cast doubts on problems that all humans wish to be solved (eye issues are a big one) just don‚Äôt sell as well.

This man is peddling hope. But false hope is as bad as any. His disparagement of genes having any influence on eyesight falsely empowers the hopeful that magical change is possible.   Maybe he has expertise in some area  which another podcast covers but I highly doubt it. 

If you want to read a book that might change your life (but probably not your eyesight) breath by James Nestor is FANTASTIC! breathwork will change your health, your mental and ultimately your life."

‚ù§Ô∏è,~Mama Mary,08/18/2021,4 Stars,"I just found you on the Jay Shetty Podcast and found the information very interesting, so I decided to dive in and listen to some of the other information you have shared across platforms. I can‚Äôt wait to start juicing celery and to try some of your other recipes. I also plan to purchase your books as well! I believe in the healing power of the body! As Barbara O‚ÄôNeil says: ‚Äúthe body can heal itself if it‚Äôs given the right conditions!‚Äù 
However, I am a bit put off by your constant need to boast about yourself. For some reason your ego is on full display on your YouTube channel‚Ä¶ your content and knowledge is amazing‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to continuously take a defensive stance toward your critics. Just put the information out and let the results speak for themselves. In the long run that hurts your credibility and wounds the spirit that you are delivering in your content. Keep doing an amazing job at helping spread your message, but leave your ego behind.
Peace and love!"

I don‚Äôt know how Anthony has done this for 35 yrs! Thank you AW for the truth and for the strength to share this. Look forward to more critical information.
READ THIS IF YOU ARE NEW!!,Fia_Draws,05/17/2021,5 Stars,"I‚Äôm a vegan who has been listening for years it is amazing. If you are struggling with any condition Anthony will find a way! They are a amazing healer!! You want to meditate? This Podcast has that too! Please listen, it‚Äôs helped me a lot and it will help you too!"
Read his books & drank the celery juice BUT,sarasgotadog,05/19/2021,1 Star,The man isn‚Äôt a doctor or healthcare professional.  The arrogance is pretty mind blowing.  I had no idea how out there he was until revisiting his Instagram and browsing the episode titles.
Nothing but the truth,ricofromaviv,05/17/2021,5 Stars,"Thank GOD I found mm. no doctor could help me with my debilitating pain, IBS symptoms. At one point I spent 8 hrs/day in the bathroom from. Lost my job. Got neither answers nor helpful guidance from over a dozen doctors and naturopaths I visited. Finally, I tried mm info and have been slowly healing ever since. On my third year of ‚Äòno foods‚Äô, daily CJ, HMDS, zinc, b12, vit C (and more), one 28 day cleans and twice on the super helpful mono (banana) eating. At times I was doubtful, because its a slow process, and there were occasional ‚Äústeps back‚Äù, but overall it saved me! Got back to work. Switched off the air freshener at their bathroom (no one noticed üëª). Thank you AW&SOC for getting my life back ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Life changing,SCW30,05/15/2021,5 Stars,"Thank you Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion for this life-changing information. I am two months in to the Morning Cleanse and a completely revamped lifestyle. Listening to these podcasts has given me the knowledge, hope, inspiration, and motivation to keep going with the protocols I need to heal my symptoms and chronic illness. The newer podcasts and meditations are fueled with a poetic prayerfulness that is powerful. I am eternally grateful to the Medical Medium and I will continue to be a student and do my best to share what I learn with those around me."
GRATEFUL,cheyennedorothy,04/25/2021,5 Stars,"Update: I‚Äôm so curious where Anthony has been. I‚Äôm also SOOOO wanting information on the covid vaccine and covid in general. I feel like if Anthony talks about the truth of this, people will really be after him. But still, I feel it‚Äôs inevitable he talks about it and can‚Äôt wait to hear. 

Beyond grateful for Anthony continuing to share his gifts through highly accessible ways. I have healed in so many ways with my anxiety, depression, debilitating brain fog, the list goes ON. But not only have I healed, I understand the true cause behind all of it. He shares such useful information I want the entire world to be part of. I want to explode with such passion for his work. And for once, I don‚Äôt feel so alone with understanding health in this way. Thank you, soooooo muchhhhh Anthony."
Repetitive,TED monster,05/14/2021,1 Star,"I tried this podcast. But when somebody repeats and repeats leading information, it makes me think that it‚Äôs all fake. If you want to impart good information, just give us the facts. There‚Äôs no need to pad it so much. I know that might make these much shorter episodes, but ultimately will serve your public well."
Be more Concise,simondavis14,04/26/2021,2 Stars,Good show but I wish he would just give the information instead of going off on tangents and giving so many examples after the point is clearly made.
So informative!,Cbhdckscdssjhbchisjsdb,04/23/2021,5 Stars,"I have a few of his books, and I just stumbled across the podcast and was thrilled!I am already binge listening to those things that apply to me. To the gentleman who said he is a scam and owns a vitamin company..so what?He has to earn a living like everybody else, and if they are supplements that help people I don‚Äôt see what the issue is. Yes, yes, do your research before passing judgment.I have already experienced improved health from his book about foods.I have a degree in nutrition and never learned this stuff. Thank you for this podcast!"
Grateful,Edwüé∏,04/23/2021,5 Stars,"As Anthony himself has said, street credibility speaks volumes, just like his books, live teachings,podcasts. The messages for greater health consciousness is coming through loud and clear for me."
Amazing Information from an Amazing Source,PKlty,04/15/2021,5 Stars,I am forever grateful to Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion for all the information they have provided. Celery juice is truly a miracle. I haven‚Äôt felt better since I started drinking it everyday. This podcast is the best. So informative!!! I learn more and more every time I listen to another episode. God Bless you Always AW for all you do for us. I love you! üôèüèºüíñ
"Lovingly asking for more on information on the solution, less energy on the problem",Sarah ELisa Love,04/17/2021,2 Stars,"Ok- did not know about the blood. Donated regularly to help people-and I thought my body recreating wbc and RBc would occur-I even believe the big pharma stuff - and medical testing theories Anthony talks about-but now what? Are we screwed or can our bodies recover from the blood draws? Podcasts that leave me feeling hopeless- I don‚Äôt think are helpful . 
Will my body replenish my blood? Can bone marrow run out of wbc‚Äôs? How do I heal my bone marrow? Can I replenish my wbc , rbc, plasma, platelet reserves? I felt good after donating- now I feel scared. What are the solutions? -  besides vimergy and diet- which I already do.  I followed all medical medium protocol- I  caught an infection from too much juicing- I was not thoroughly cleaning the cutting board- and bacteria grew on the board - thoroughly scrubbing the juicer, scrubbing the outsides of all fruits and veggies / ( melon , cantaloupe) that you cut into - and scrubbing the cutting board are not talked about enough in my opinion. But now I know. I would love More information on how/ or if  the body can create new wbc, rbc, and plasma- if the body cannot- please  go into that - is there a solution or should I just kill myself now?"

Blood draw,Roseannf,04/02/2021,3 Stars,"I hear what you are saying and I understand about the stress of drawing blood. I am just not sure what supports these statements.  If blood wasn‚Äôt  or isn‚Äôt drawn, how else are you able to diagnose a person?  I have identified ALOT with a blood draw and it is quite necessary.
If you need testing, what other biological medium should be used?"
Blood,WhitneyFinn,04/01/2021,5 Stars,How does medical medium feel about IV ozone therapy?
Miraculous,Jennie Becca 11,04/01/2021,5 Stars,"Anthony has brought miraculous information to the world that will not be heard anywhere else. His information saved my life beginning five  years ago when I was so sick , bedridden with anxiety and panic and depression, had seen near 50 doctors with six of them being neurosurgeons. I had lost 50 pounds in nearly two months time and no answers from any of those near 50 doctors except that a ‚Äúbrain surgery possibly may help‚Äù for my brain condition (Chiari Malformariin), and A life threatening brain surgery at that. No guarantee. Starting his protocols showed positive effects very quickly. I am living proof that his information is real along with many others in the MM community. His information hasn‚Äôt failed me yet. Forever grateful. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I think we should listen!,Mknightwindmill,03/29/2021,5 Stars,Everything Anthony tells us makes sense. I think I will be listening to him and reading his books for a very long time~
Changed my life,f6m1995,03/26/2021,5 Stars,Best podcast ever it has changed my life !
AW is a gift to the sick!,suspence7,03/25/2021,5 Stars,"The more I learn about A-Dub (that‚Äôs my made up name) for this teacher, the more I realize how genuine of a person he is. Makes you wonder how many of us act and feel a certain way due to the mass invaders of our body‚Äôs and minds. His knowledge resonates with me."
"Great, but where are the uploads?",ajbdjc,03/23/2021,5 Stars,"Hi, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but nothing has changed my life like the the Medical Medium podcasts! I have already ordered Anthony‚Äôs books, but I am just wondering when the next episodes of this podcast will arrive! I have listed to all of the new episodes probably a thousand times, and the old ones don't seem to interest me so much, I just hope you doing well and am wishing you the best! :)"
The ugly truth,Nanriver,03/21/2021,5 Stars,"I love his podcast! Anthony Williams educates you about the true reason we‚Äôre sick or get sick. You‚Äôre able to learn from his books and all the free tools he offers to heal. 
He‚Äôs truly sincere about helping people!"
Incredibly Thankful,Rosieque,03/21/2021,5 Stars,Very interesting and helpful information shared by AW.
Absolutely mind blowing truth.,Totallyshocked,03/15/2021,5 Stars,"Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to hear the truth, but we need to listen so we can protect ourselves. I look forward to more information from AW on this amazing podcast. Thank you for all you do üôèüèΩ"
Great info/ Too many tangents,heatherplong,03/18/2021,4 Stars,"I love his books, but these podcasts are so hard to listen to, because he goes off on so many side tangents. The latest one that has me writing this review is how we gamble with our health, which is true, but he goes on for way too long on how a person gambles there car away and then gambled their phone away and on and on... Love the info, just wish he would stick with that and make shorter podcast rather than long podcasts that go off on these random stories."
Alive & well,Tiffdow,03/10/2021,5 Stars,"I‚Äôve been on Medical Medium protocol for 5 years now. I can say that I have no more tumors. My teeth don‚Äôt need fillings or caps anymore either. My hair stopped falling out and I have energy. 
Thank you AW for all of the hard work that you do to help us here on earth.
I love you-we love you!!!"
Grateful,Christine Batra,03/09/2021,5 Stars,"Thank you Anthony for your sacrifice and commitment to evolving humankind. Your work resonates truth. Just after 5 days of applying Spirit‚Äôs knowledge and recommendations, I feel much better post covid."
True Freedom lies between the lines,A&B Lover,03/08/2021,5 Stars,"Listen to all of his podcasts, apply his advice, and you will know freedom. I have been applying the advice of AW   SOC since 2018 and I‚Äôve never been happier and healthier. I feel like I have much more energy than I ever had and I don‚Äôt need the help of any caffeinated drinks. We are so used to living our lives on some highs - drugs, foods, drinks...and the worst: pharma. AW has the information you need to break free from the hamster wheel of death and start living your life outside the lines of this false world. AW is the only one out there speaking the truth as his truth comes from the purest of the pure: The Spirit of Compassion. I am so grateful to you AW and SOC you have changed my life and I am honored to have been given the gift of health through your life changing information. Infinite Love"
medical medium protocols changed my life!,arielelle,02/25/2021,5 Stars,"at 28 i started suffering unexplained symptoms like muscle aches, severe headaches, pain radiating up my spine. i‚Äôm a nurse. i look ‚Äúperfectly healthy,‚Äù but i felt like i was dying. and no one believed i was sick. i was living off of coffee, i tried keto diet, i tried low carb, low sugar, limited fruit & nothing worked. i finally woke one day feeling like i was hit by a truck and couldn‚Äôt get out of bed (again at age 28). i luckily had the books on my bookshelf but hadn‚Äôt opened them yet. something inside of me urged me to open book 1 Medical Medium. the 28 day cleanse i started THAT DAY. and within 3 days my pain was gone. symptoms were improving. i was still tired but IT WAS WORKING. i drink celery juice daily now. and i swear it has saved my life. please try this advice if you are still looking for answers. i knew if i went to the doctor (because i work with them) they would tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine,‚Äù or that i have autoimmune. i refused to see a doctor. Medical Medium‚Äôs protocols work."
Inaccurate,balebeau,03/03/2021,1 Star,"Please get your information from credible sources which are absolutely not this guy. This was unbearable for anyone that understands nutrition and science. Also, if your doctors aren‚Äôt listening to you...find a new doctor or an NP or a DO. Find a trained professional that you are able to connect with better. But it‚Äôs not this guy."
Every listen is even better than the last,Bee.yonka,02/24/2021,5 Stars,"Words cannot describe the gratitude I feel for the medical medium information, dedication, and work. I am moved to tears with every podcast and am finally finding support to help myself and not feel alone. Thank God I found you and will spread your work to everyone I know."
"Love every topic you held, Anthony. Thank you!",LNKK87,02/02/2021,5 Stars,"I had read your books, follow you facebook, instagram and this podcast. You‚Äôre amazing person that send us the best messages that cure our health and soul. Thanks God for having you in this century. Thanks Compassion Spirit who help you as well."
Celery juice doesn‚Äôt cure OCD,tobehonestthough...,02/18/2021,1 Star,"OCD is chronic. The gold standard to keep OCD in remission is ERP and CBT from a licensed professional. OCD has been studied by neurologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists for a long time. They have several therapies and medicines that help, however a CELERY JUICE isn‚Äôt ever listed by the top professionals who have spent their life studying this illness. 
It is so dangerous to suggest this illness can be ‚Äúhealed‚Äù so easily. To claim this can pull people away from actual help, delaying life saving treatment. 
If you are experiencing ANY mental illness that is disruptive to you life and happiness, please seek out help from a professional or ask your medical doctor. And please, don‚Äôt let OCD steal your life a moment longer. Don‚Äôt fall for this nonsense. Life can be wonderful once you find the right help."

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,Elenaginu,01/28/2021,5 Stars,Thank you for the beautiful meditation!
Life-changing,In√®s,01/12/2021,5 Stars,"I have learnt so many valuable information from these podcasts episodes. I wish everyone in the world could listen to them as it would make such a huge positive difference in everyone‚Äôs health.
Thank you to Anthony William for sharing this knowledge with us, I can not wait for more episodes! I also strongly recommend the meditiations, there were my first ever guided meditations and I am now repeating them whenever I want to meditate. 
Thank you!!!!
If you don‚Äôt know about them, the host also published a series of mind-blowing books ‚ÄúMedical Medium‚Äù. Check them out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.,123bmoon,01/23/2021,1 Star,"Please work with a doctor and take where his info comes from with a grain of salt. I followed him for 10 months strictly and drank 32oz of celery juice for 8 months. Started not being able to tolerate any sodium at all, would not be able to swallow if I ate any sodium. I was getting too much sodium and yes some of my symptoms are better and some of his info does work... however all you have to be is a smart man studying under people and to do tons of research to know a lot of great info. And a lot of illnesses and conditioned can't be cured but maintained. Maybe you will also eventually dig up info you didn‚Äôt want to know about certain people....
Also he shouldn‚Äôt be telling everyone it‚Äôs coming from a pure source.... people are turned against their doctors 100% and people have been hurt... hmm."
Fact check alert!,Becca phd soon to be MD,01/13/2021,2 Stars,Just listened to the brain fog episode. Viruses ARE NOT alive! They don‚Äôt eat. That‚Äôs not how they reproduce. He got an extra star because he‚Äôs engaging. How is someone privy to facts that have not been discovered yet? Science is holding out? What? That‚Äôs not how publish or parish works!
Life altering,Linnets phone 6+,01/03/2021,5 Stars,"In the world we live in now, it‚Äôs great to read, listen and practice AWs words that resonate deep within me!  We all need hope and that‚Äôs what his words from spirit of compassion provide!  I personally have dealt with health issues and continue to have celery juice every day!  There aren‚Äôt words to describe how thankful I am for you sharing your knowledgeüôèüíú"
My husband and I have transformed our health through Medical Medium,smoky_mtn_paradise,12/12/2020,5 Stars,"Since finding Medical Medium, I have been blessed with Divine information provided in the book series to heal Fibromyalgia, restless leg, brain fog, adrenal fatigue, food allergies, life long digestive disorders, nausea, bloating, constipation, stomach ulcers, endometriosis, diverticulitis, adrenal fatigue, mystery pain and numbness in my limbs, chronic back and shoulder pain, memory loss, blurry vision, rapid aging, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal tendencies. At age 48, I could barely walk at times for intense mystery pain throughout my body. This is what prompted me to search out natural ways to heal, and how I found the Medical Medium books. Now, at age 51, I run up and down a mountain with no pain. I thank God every day for guiding me to Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion. When my husband went down on his back unable to move with severe pain for 2 solid months, we utilized the Medical Medium protocols specific to his needs. It only took one week for him to recover and avoid major surgery. These podcasts are free gift offerings from the compassion of Anthony‚Äôs heart. The meditations bring profound spiritual and emotional healing. Once you realize that this is Divine Guidance provided with unconditional love, your heart resonates to all that is Truth. Your health transformation begins the first day you read the first living word from the books, or listen to the first podcast, and life as you knew it transcends. Medical Medium saved my health, and my husband‚Äôs. In countless ways, he‚Äôs saved our lives, and millions of others around the world. May God continue to bless Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion. They are guiding each of us to awaken; to empower healing; to rise out of the ashes and into the light. We are deeply blessed to have their presence in our lives.‚ô•Ô∏è"
Tone and Structure is awful,Katiebug8771,12/29/2020,1 Star,"I‚Äôve loved Anthony‚Äôs books for 3/4 year now and enjoyed every interview I‚Äôve watched but this podcast is just unbearable. Is it intended for children? I could only stand 10 minutes because he explains relatively simple concepts as if you have zero understanding of your body. 
 I know he‚Äôs changed many lives for the better, so maybe that baby-talk is what works for some people but for me, it‚Äôs beyond irritating. Maybe he could have beginner vs. intermediate levels of health topics, I‚Äôd gladly update my rating if so!"
Amazing Information!! Thank you üôè,Lourdes901,12/12/2020,5 Stars,"Thank you AW and spirit of compassion!! 
This podcasts are full of great information that help us healing and I can‚Äôt believe that it is free. I am grateful for his books and Apple podcasts.  Life changing for sure."
Life-giving messages,bielclam,12/07/2020,5 Stars,How great it is to be able to listen to Anthony Williams on Apple Podcasts! What a Godsend he is. My healing journey truly began in earnest when I started adopting AW‚Äôs suggestions. My life has greatly improved and I will always listen to Apple Podcasts as long as he contributes. I could NOT be more thankful. Blessings to all who are on this journey! ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè
Interesting but Repetitive,briem16,12/07/2020,4 Stars,These podcasts are interesting but could easily be shorter and more focused. They also spend so much time addressing the problem and very little time telling you what to do to fix it. I would like them to be more focused on exactly what to do to help yourself.
Best podcast ever!,Cakewalk76,11/30/2020,5 Stars,"I was so thrilled when Medical Medium started his podcast. Not only is it jam packed with new information, the old information is shared with more nuance. The spiritual meanings of the poems from Spirit of Most High or Spirit of Compassion are for me, the highlight of the podcasts. They resonate deeply for me every time. You will not be disappointed!"
Love the info...not the delivery,Spacindy,12/04/2020,4 Stars,"The information shared in these podcasts could easily be cut down to 30 minutes...and be enjoyable to listen to...but and hour + is just too much...particularly because it‚Äôs redundant, repetitive and eventually you just can‚Äôt listen anymore. This is so unfortunate because Anthony has so much good information to share. I hope the podcast producers will listen and make this format a powerhouse of information instead of feeling like someone is dragging their nails across a chalkboard very very slowly...let‚Äôs get to the ‚Äòmeat‚Äô (pun intended) of an issue sooner rather than later! Thank you for sharing Anthony!"
He is real people,orionsdreamystars,11/29/2020,5 Stars,"I have bought his books and listen to his podcast. Drinking celery juice and lemon water. Switched to plant based diet and dropped the hot chocolate. I feel AMAZING!! 
I understand everyone is different but please just give it a 30 day try. What can it hurt.... NOTHING. I‚Äôm in love with Medical Medium."
Godsend,peggiepie,11/29/2020,5 Stars,"I am so thankful for Anthony William and all of the helpful healing information he has brought to light!

Starting year 3 with Medical Medium,Celerrific!!,11/28/2020,5 Stars,"Feeling better and better all of the time has been the overarching theme since I started reading MM two years ago. I read his first book, the Anthony William origin story if you will, and started in frozen blueberries the next day because I had some. VOILA!! One day of blueberries and already I felt a small but sure uptick. 

So I bought the recommended juicer and did celery juice each day. By day four, I was noticing that I felt better again. Now two years in, I can‚Äôt imagine life without celery juice. 

I have completed 4 of his 9-day cleanses over the two years and they are really healing and health building but all levels mind, body and spirit. 

If you are a person who struggles with health issues, buy his books, there are six at this time. Read and educate yourself, listen to his podcasts, take baby steps until you can stride. It will transform your life exponentially for the best. Thank you AW for MM and thank you Spirit of Compassion üôÇ"
"Superb, game-changing, compassionate",andrewkiichi,11/28/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony is a massive blessing. The production value with the intro/outro music isn‚Äôt the best curtain of Anthony‚Äôs extraordinary insights and healing modalities in my humble opinion, as well as the scripted reads and rhyming scatting take away from Anthony‚Äôs innate charm and flow. BUT with that said, he‚Äôs still an angel, his books and deep cache of radio show episodes are healing blessings that will forever be cherished, appreciated and respected!!"
Miracle,Happily Healing,11/25/2020,5 Stars,Anthony is a miracle!  His information has forever changed my life.  I was praying hard for answers on how to take care of myself and heal Hashimotos when my mom brought home a magazine article.

Life Changing Information! You Can Heal!üïä,marisaspiritual,11/25/2020,5 Stars,"The Medical Medium Podcast episodes are incredible. Life changing information that will not only change your life for the better, but for the best! You can heal with these protocols! I‚Äôm living evidence! 

How could I ever summarize my profound gratitude and heartfelt appreciation for all that Anthony does, has done and continues to do? By spreading his vibrant light and guidance to all that I can. Anthony is the living example of faith, hope and love. Anthony is as close as we can get to God here on Earth, a true blessing. I am grateful and thankful to the Divine World for awakening my soul to his guidance. I pray that every soul may do the same and achieve all the healing, peace, love and joy that they so very much deserve. Thank you, Anthony, for all your precious time and humble efforts that you sacrifice to help so many.

It seems like there is just too much information out there...HOWEVER I feel 100% confident that Anthony is here to help us all  delivering divine information and truths as uncomfortable as they may be.  I have several of his books and I‚Äôm just loving these well spoken podcasts ! 
I am absolutely hooked! 
Thank you for these podcasts and your books Anthony Williams! I very much appreciate everything you speak for us humans !"
Real deal for healing,Snuffalupacephalopod,11/21/2020,5 Stars,"If someone is sick with chronic illness, Anthony William has the real information to heal their condition. His books have all the needed info, but the podcast is another way of learning some info if reading a big book isn‚Äôt easy for someone. The meditations are so soothing and healing. Give just those a listen if the regular podcast is too much."
Love this Podcast-SO HELPFUL!,TXTheatreMom,11/21/2020,5 Stars,This is such a great podcast filled with helpful information on how to take your health into your own hands. Thank you for all you do Medical Medium!
If you want to heal this is the path,JNDC14,11/20/2020,5 Stars,It‚Äôs amazing how Anthony gives concise explanations that everyone can follow and understand for conditions and symptoms that the medical and alternative health communities continue to struggle with!

How to Heal,A2P2,11/20/2020,5 Stars,"The Medical Medium has given me the information to heal my chronic fatigue, joint pain, and muscle weakness. No doctor was able to help, even holistic ones.  His information is the truth, evidenced by so many of us healing by following his protocols."

Powerfully B12 Trick or Treat,Ulla Monet,11/15/2020,5 Stars,"#medicalmedium #medicalmediumpodcasts. What a very Powerful incredible podcast. Wow, very mind blowing. You have exposed the very evil that haunts us, yet you have given us the tools to heal. This podcast will open your eyes. 

Sadly, I was one that received B12 shots once a week for years. I never felt any better and now I know why.  

Such simplicity. It all makes amazing sense. The powerful conviction that we will heal. To listen to our body and be in tune with it. how spiritually beautiful.  We will heal thanks to you and your compassion. 

God has blessed Anthony with the insight, knowledge and spirit of compassion.  God please watch over Anthony and keep him safe. Powerful ground breaking knowledge from above.

Humbled and very grateful for the amazing resource. I keep listening over and over to the Chem trails, fruits fear & Killing you smelly, your meditations, Eggs, apple cider vinegar,  neurological podcasts. All are so Powerful! always something I missed and feel even more empowered to listen to them over and over. Your Gentle voice soothes the harshness of the reality.

Fantastic!,Community Hospital Rehab,11/12/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William dives in where others dare to glance. I very much appreciate the wisdom and compassionate delivery of information, coupled with humor and rap-ready verse. The Medical Medium lifestyle makes a great difference. We don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know, but he does and shares the information freely with style! Thank you!"
Repeats,555 jmh,11/13/2020,1 Star,I love his info but he drags it out . May be 45 mins into an hour podcast and you‚Äôre still waiting for new information. The chem trail one was drug out so far I‚Äôm wondering if I should remove him from my life. He could of explained this in 15-20 mins. I hope he rethinks how he speaks . The new music is sinister like. Why? It‚Äôs disturbing. I no longer recommend him. But only cuz of this new sinister voice & rhyming . Makes me feel like I‚Äôm a child at the Sunday library reading . It‚Äôs hard to take him seriously.
Chocolate dependency gone!,OlyaSF,11/11/2020,5 Stars,"First let me say thank you to Anthony and the Spirit of Compassion for all you do for us and all the knowledge you share with us so we can achieve better health and live happier lives! I am forever grateful to both of you üôè
After listening to the Podcast about caffeine and learning how caffeine negatively effects our bodies I decided to take a break from eating chocolate and drinking my daily black tea. This was not easy since I LOVE dark chocolate and would eat it almost everyday. The first week was tough and I had strong cravings. I stuck with it and now it‚Äôs been 5 weeks and I feel amazing!!!! No more cravings at all. Completely gone! My husband eats chocolate in front of me and I am not tempted to even take a bite! Since stopping all caffeine, I noticed that I feel more calm, relaxed, things don‚Äôt bother me as much as they normally would and I am loosing less hair in the shower which is a huge positive! I feel more joy in my soul, feeling good about quitting a not so healthy habit. I am sure I will eat some chocolate at some point again but it will be different. I am no longer dependent on it. I have control over myself now and don‚Äôt have a need to eat it every day. Thank you Anthony and Spirit of Compassion for shining light and exposing the truth on caffeine and it‚Äôs effects on our health and helping me quit a bad habit!!!

Takes him a while to get to the point,Vejuroan,11/11/2020,2 Stars,"I love him but I actually enjoy more reading it than listening to him. It takes him forever to deliver the information and the intro of the podcast, creates anxiety. Anthony, please listen to us, we are kindly asking you to go straight to the point when you talküíï"

"Thank you, Anthony William",Goodlife8,11/09/2020,5 Stars,"Your meditations and podcasts are truly powerful. Thank you so much, I have no words to express this gratitude but I guess at a soulful level you understand what I mean. Your passion to help ,your compassion knows no limit, you and your partner above , inside and behind you.

Meditations,plantbasedmommin,11/05/2020,5 Stars,"There are so many positive words that I could write about Anthony William and how he has helped me on a beautiful healing journey, but this review is simply for the meditations.

Two words: GAME CHANGER 
Give it a listen. The only thing you have to lose is yourself, it‚Äôs definitely worth a shot. Blessings"
I have all of the Medical Medium books,catherine renee,11/05/2020,3 Stars,I have all the books.  Anthony seems like a dearly gifted man!  But please cut your prologues ( politely asking;).  I have anxiety and waited through a lot of stuff to get to the part where you actually talk about the solution for anxiety;). Thank you!
"Restored my faith, helped me heal...",Erin Roxbury,11/04/2020,5 Stars,"At 35, when my children were young and I was chronically sick with many neurological symptoms, anxiety and more... After seeing 3 doctors, I was desperate for answers. I finally prayed out loud one night for help in soon after, I was directed to Anthony‚Äôs work by a friend. With His guidance, I was able to turn my life and health around. There was and still is a deep peace that comes with feeling I can trust the messages presented by AW and Spirit. And with that, all of the other confusing contradictory information out there falls away. I urge anyone struggling with anything to take a deep dive into this healing information, to give it a try and to have faith."
Thank You!,Wye2003,11/02/2020,5 Stars,I‚Äôve read and continuously study Anthony William‚Äôs books. So it is a special treat to hear Anthony speak from his heart while I am traveling. I like hearing his feelings!
Life Saver,MaryBagle,11/01/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony Wiliam is a God send. After following his protocols for thyroid healing for the past 9 months, I feel better than I have in years!!  I'm off my thyroid meds and maintaining optimal health by eating the right foods.  Bless you Anthony!!"

Love him,andrea086372,10/31/2020,5 Stars,"If you‚Äôre health conscious and spiritual, this podcast is for you."
If you're tired of being sick and want to heal...listen,J Hiigel,10/29/2020,5 Stars,"Medical Medium information got me healing when nothing else did. Decades of trying, only to have my symptoms come back...until I discovered Anthony's information. My whole outlook on life has changed. If you want to finally heal, listen, read, learn and then start incorporating his recommendations...baby steps are okay, if that's all you can handle. Or you can ramp it up and dive in to heal faster."
Awful,dough3,10/30/2020,1 Star,Gave me anxiety listening- just went on and on and on about examples- no help- or at least I couldn‚Äôt listen any longer to even see if an hour in there were any usable techniques. Very disappointed.
Anxiety,Funny Frannie,10/30/2020,4 Stars,He was good but spent way too much time explaining anxiety sensations and not enough time on how to get rid of them. And where are the meditations he suggested?  I‚Äôd like to try them please!!! Thank You!!!
Delayed Learning,**KLK**,10/30/2020,2 Stars,"I like his stuff but dislike the long and delayed answers. It‚Äôs like he goes through too much prelim story telling and I do not have the time for that. Please, just get to it."

Very repetitive and Difficult to Listen to,Nikkihuy,10/29/2020,1 Star,His delivery makes it very difficult to listen to.  He says the same things over in different ways (which could be good) but it becomes monotonous and at times whiny sounding. I prefer to utilize time better by hearing more information rather than repeating over and over. I appreciate his journey and effort but at this time I‚Äôd recommend other wellness podcasts like Dr. Cabral or Wellness Mama.
Terrible meditation,Lschlan5,10/29/2020,3 Stars,I am sad because I really like the medical medium message and books but the fear meditation is truly truly lacking and induced fear rather than alleviating it. Standing on a bridge that‚Äôs surrounded by destruction and confusion for nearly 20 min? I meditate a lot and I have never experienced a meditation to be so awful.
Anthony William is truly extraordinary.,ValentinaGaylord,10/27/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William saved my life.  I am now completely healed, vibrantly healthy and have more energy than I truly know what to do with.  He was the only person to properly understand what was happening in my body and how to heal me.  After spending years seeing all kinds of Doctors and Specialists, Anthony was the shining light that lead me through the darkness.  I am now on the other side of this thanks to this phenomenal man, his many gifts and his Spirit.  Forever grateful, Valentina"
Embarrassing delivery,RiannaLambert,10/27/2020,1 Star,Delivery is embarrassing. I enjoy his recipes and have had an open mind to his info but this is a huge turn off
Anthony William‚Äôs is the REAL DEAL!,KristiFit,10/27/2020,5 Stars,"The Medical Medium‚Äôs podcasts are powerful and life changing. If you have an open enough mind to really digest his ground breaking information (message from spirit) and adopt as much as you can of it as part of your lifestyle, your world will change for the better because your health and outlook on life will be so much better.  You will be compelled to pass on what you have learned to whoever will listen. It is that real and powerful!"
BEST podcast!,Tatyanna C,10/25/2020,5 Stars,"He‚Äôs the best, just listen :)"
LIFE CHANGING,LaurenAG211,10/24/2020,5 Stars,I love Anthony and all he does. I would be compltely lost without him. I am beyond greatful for him and his podcasts. The podcast are intreaging to listen too. The information supplied is great to know. I only wish I came across him years ago. I noticed a few low reviews mentions he gets angry and annoyed...I LOVE when he does that!!!!  It shows his passion for what he does and gets annoyed as he wants to help us all. I think it funny too :)  LOVE....THESE...PODCASTS!
Doom and gloom,miss kiya,10/24/2020,1 Star,"I‚Äôve recently come across your page on Instagram and wanted to listen to your podcast to learn more. I‚Äôve listened to a few minutes of the B12 episode and decided to tune out. I was hoping that you‚Äôd share knowledge about the subjects and facts, research, versus painting this tale of mayhem and mischief. It‚Äôs almost as if you want to create a chasm between meat eaters and ‚Äúplant based‚Äù and ‚Äúvegans‚Äù versus educating listeners around your factual findings.There‚Äôs enough doom and gloom and polarization in the world right now especially in the United States and I don‚Äôt tune in to a podcast to be pitted against vegans or Plant based folks. I‚Äôm interested in learning about the information that you are presenting not doom and gloom scenarios. I really wish you would stick to facts and take this shock value storytelling element out of your Podcasts, it‚Äôs lame and it‚Äôs a waste of peoples time"
Fantastic information,Gina L I,10/23/2020,5 Stars,"Another great podcast! I love everything about your podcasts, from you‚Äôre deliverance to the humor. Thank you AW and SOC!"
Grateful!,Saffa Lou,10/23/2020,5 Stars,So very grateful I stumbled across Medical Medium podcasts while looking for a meaningful one to listen to about 5 weeks ago. Such amazing info that I wish I could ‚Äòforce‚Äô on everyone I know! I guess time will show those around me how much I‚Äôm changing for the better because of AW!! Thank you!!!!!!
Beware...You can‚Äôt handle the truth.,fwmike,10/23/2020,5 Stars,"Thanks to my medical doctor who introduced me to Anthony‚Äôs information four years ago, I have come back from the living dead and am still making gains everyday. Despite all of Anthony‚Äôs information in his books, Facebook posts, and other content, there are so many unanswered questions about why, why, why is all of this chronic illness happening in the world.  All of these new podcasts are much less censored and he sneaks in bits of ‚Äòdisturbing truth‚Äô in each episode, especially through his unique poems.  If you are sensitive to ‚Äòtruth‚Äô...aka evil amongst us...you may want to stick to his books. Those of us who are sick and tired of being held down and are finally healed enough to start fighting back, we are the ones who need this sick truth revealed so we can fight not just for ourselves anymore, but for all of humanity. Thank you Spirit of Compassion and Anthony! Don‚Äôt ever stop!"
Lil bit crazy...but possibly genius.,Doc 4 !!!,10/23/2020,4 Stars,Sounds more like an audio book novel for teens. Yet undeniably valuable info. üëç
A True Medical Documentary Podcast,Jayden Tsao,10/22/2020,5 Stars,"So incredibly grateful for these podcasts!! I have all the Medical Medium books, but with a busy life of work, traveling, kids, etc it‚Äôs hard to be able to sit down for a few hours to read and digest all the mind-blowing information. I listen to these podcasts repeatedly even with my kids (meditations). I listen while I‚Äôm making my celery juice, doing dishes, driving, grocery shopping, waiting for the kids etc... I feel empowered and blessed and grateful for the information put out there for all of us to heal and live our best lives possible. And the best part...? It‚Äôs all FREE. Uninterrupted. Free from ads. True advanced medical information made available to anyone looking or willing to open an ear to truth... The podcasts are also hilarious, poetic, deep, compassionate, and real. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! ü•∞üôè"
Medical Medium is a life saver. He gives me hope,Susie 501,10/22/2020,5 Stars,Anthony Williams has given me hope of healing. I‚Äôm stopping listening to all others at this point. Because I have trust in him. I‚Äôve started my journey of healing. He has been blessed with a gift and shares his gift for free with us all.
Best Podcast I‚Äôve Heard!,[NicknameTaken],10/21/2020,5 Stars,"I have been listening to health podcasts since 2012. This is the best I‚Äôve heard! And yet, it‚Äôs not really even a podcast. Each episode is an extremely well-produced, entertaining, engaging spoken word performance that teaches you information that you cannot find anywhere else that can change (or even save) your life. I eagerly await new episodes which are one of the highlights of my week!"
Life changing information,rachbabe1111,10/21/2020,5 Stars,These podcasts are full os life saving information and I love to share them with my family. #1 podcast I‚Äôve ever listened to. Thank you Anthony!!

Unique information,Cgirl912,10/20/2020,5 Stars,"I always knew about chem trails but the information here explains the why behind it and why it‚Äôs connected to so many other things such as the birds, bees and fish turning up dead. Such Valuable information.  Everyone needs to listen to this.  Thank you."
B12 great episode helpful information,tahkole,10/20/2020,5 Stars,B12 great episode helpful information
His information has been life changing for me,courtneyallphin,10/17/2020,5 Stars,"I love listening to Anthony, his information has changed my life and I‚Äôll forever appreciate him for sharing this info.  Be open minded and truly listen to him with an open heart and you will be surprised."
Introduction and closing is too dramatic!,Kathleen38,10/19/2020,1 Star,"I love Anthony William and have been following his advice for over a year. I loved his old radio shows and find his podcast very informative. I really can‚Äôt stand this rhyming rap talk, the baby talk voices during his storytelling and the beginning and ending music is way too dramatic and over-the-top! I used to share his radio shows but won‚Äôt now because of this behaviorüò¢It makes him seem less credibleüò¢I really hope he changes it!!!"
Condescending delivery,Tsmac88,10/19/2020,1 Star,"Ugh, I really tried to give this podcast a try but the way he talks down to his audience like they are kids is unbearable. Also, idk if he does it at the end but there were no citing of source of the info..."
The best,vskshe,10/16/2020,5 Stars,Just listen.
Stick to the info,lelab‚ù§Ô∏è,10/17/2020,3 Stars,I find some of his information very interesting and helpful. I do not like the lead up with the change in his voice when creating conversations of others. It would be best to skip that.
Amazing!!,ShaylaG.,10/16/2020,5 Stars,"Such powerful words and advice. What is being said makes sense, and is so empowering. Had in Tears!!!"
I love the commentary!  Absolutely love these podcast,littlebulewbordie,10/15/2020,5 Stars,"MM has a fun way of telling the story examples as how people think when it comes to Apple cider vinegar.

Rambling mess,RN-1963,10/16/2020,1 Star,I listened to the Protein episode and it was almost unbearable. The first 20 minutes was repetitive hype for info that never really arrived. One of the worst podcast episodes I‚Äôve ever endured.
Podcast,wont let me posr,10/16/2020,2 Stars,"I have been following Anthony Williams for a year now and his protocols have brought my health back. That being said, these podcasts are like listening to a child when he goes off about science and research. We know his feelings about science and research so I don‚Äôt understand why he has to spend the first 10 to 15 minutes mocking it to a point of annoyance every podcast. It‚Äôs a turn off. Your information is important but you are losing people with the childish antics in the beginning of every podcast. Get to the point. Sorry just my opinion."
LOVE his ideas but delivery is frustrating,Brem0036,10/15/2020,3 Stars,It‚Äôs so hard to get past the delivery. I LOVE the information but it feels like his audience is a group of 4 year olds. All of his talks could be so much more streamlined and efficient if he just stuck to the core information and left out all the stories.
Condescending and lack of sourcing,in4mme,10/15/2020,1 Star,Had to stop listening. Condescending tone like we‚Äôre all ignorant. Then throwing out statements without any evidence or references. No way to know if any of it is fact.
Apple cider,tracytruthseeker‚ù§Ô∏è,10/15/2020,1 Star,I understand the message and love the information! But not really understanding the weird baby talk ? Where it seems like we‚Äôre all stupid? Just talk normal without being condescending please it makes it hard to listen and your podcasts are too long saying the same information over and over no need for that were sick not stupid üôèü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôè
"Thank you, Anthony. Seriously.",Lauren Lives Again,10/15/2020,5 Stars,"I‚Äôm brought to tears every time I see how much content Anthony is putting out into the world.

Medical Medium‚Äôs protocol IS life-changing. As a 25-year-old who dealt with heart palpitations, Lyme, chronic sore throats, chronic fatigue, cystic body acne since I was 11, lightheadedness"
Regarding Caffeine and eggs!,Debrah Jean,10/14/2020,5 Stars,These are the first two podcasts that I listened too and I‚Äôm blown away by his knowledge!! I‚Äôm excited to get off both of these and get my health back!! I highly recommend this guy!! He knows what he‚Äôs talking about!!
"Rotten ego, bad energy, don‚Äôt trust him",whydonineedtotypeanythinghere,10/14/2020,1 Star,"Anthony unfortunately gives me ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù. He‚Äôs angry, defensive, very frustrated, and highly ego-driven...not at all like most psychics and medical intuitives I‚Äôve known through the years. Also, there‚Äôs not only ‚Äúone‚Äù medical intuitive with answers, sir. I think if you were truly tapping into spirit you‚Äôd absolutely acknowledge that. That‚Äôs a seedy marketing man at play. If you have the gift, I‚Äôd expect you‚Äòd be happy to help and share the information with others. I know intuitives can be highly sensitive and empathic which can cause them difficulty setting emotional boundaries but this guy‚Äôs situation...seems different. Instead, he shows very clear signs of ego struggles, shady salesmanship with very black and white perspectives. Extremely unspiritual. He‚Äôs not acting out of a place of love, but from a place of a need for personal validation. Yikes. I‚Äôd steer clear. Not everything is caused by strep and Epstein-Barr. Nor will celery juice alone help clear most ailments. I just hope he gets the personal help he needs to take care of his own issues :)"
Meditations ARE Emotionally Healing!,Velvetspider,10/14/2020,5 Stars,"The meditations have helped heal me of trauma, hurt, & more. The health info has also helped heal me of chronic pain & lifelong severe depression. Thank you God,  Spirit of Compassion, & Anthony!"

After finding Anthony, his information has not only taught me about why I have these sypmtons but how to heal from them which I'm doing now and seeing incredible results. These podcasts are just another extension of his powerful information brought to him from the Spirit of Compassion and I can't say enough about how grateful I am for finding all the answers I've been searching for without any of the current medical/research biases out there. Thank you so much AW and SOC for all you do in healing the world!"
Be your own Savior,Bamboo Jane,10/12/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William's information (The Medical Medium) will empower you to become your own personal Savior. I know that his backstory is ... shall we say, ""non-conventional"", but do not hesitate to help yourself, and Heal. Personally, as a skeptic, it took me awhile to warm up to everything that he was saying ... but I followed my intuition, and I felt safe.

True Source of Healing Information,Redchuckstress,10/12/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony‚Äôs podcasts are amazing and full of the truth. The truth of the underlying causes of illnesses and symptoms. He guides us on how to heal from these symptoms as well. Anthony has greatly helped me on my healing journey when I had been through several doctors and naturopaths. I finally found out why I was sick and how to heal. So far I have healed Extreme anxiety, gastroparesis, heart palpitations, acid reflux and so much more.  I‚Äôm still cleansing and I will always be a big fan. The mediations are amazing as well. They are helping me heal from PTSD from being so sick in the past. They are helping me get myself back. These meditations are the most powerful because they come from above and they help you heal.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the healing information you share Anthony!"

Master Rapper Anthony William Medical Medium,~Gramma T,10/12/2020,5 Stars,"Thank you for the awesome poem at the end of this first podcast. Well done! Made me smile - much needed after crying about the truth you‚Äôve shared here. Yes, this one was hard to swallow at times, mostly because it is so believable and going on under our noses (or actually above them). My heart aches for all life in general because of this. The bees, the birds, the fish, we humans. Ugh! Thank you, Anthony, for sharing this. Feeling helpless since there is nothing I can do to fix the problem. Feeling anger that the problem even exists. Feeling immense gratitude for the healing information you‚Äôve shared from Spirit of Compassion to aid us in dealing with it. Thank you for sacrificing the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life you may have had for the well-being of the rest of humankind. God bless you, Anthony. Indebted eternally.~Trynnel

I tried to get along with using just some of his healing methods, but that didn‚Äôt work.   Today, I am free from that debilitating pain and never have to go back.  I see his list of foods to avoid as poison automatically.  I am now drinking 32 oz celery juice in the morning on an empty stomach; and can‚Äôt go a day without the Liver detox smoothie.

Thank you! There are no words!,ttom1028,10/07/2020,5 Stars,"There are no words to express how much Anthony Williams has changed my life. Your books, videos and podcasts have been such an inspiration to help change my mind about how I can be the one how makes me feel better! Through food, mediation, caring for myself by treating the hidden causes of why my body has been keeping me from enjoying my life. Over the past few months, through reading the Medical Medium and following the celery juicing and detoxing my chronic pain, kidney failure, reproductive and many other intestinal illnesses have been documented by my doctors to be completely heading in the best way possible in over three years. It‚Äôs truly a miracle in my eyes. With the support of my husband, family and friends this journey has been amazing."

A good meditation,Minonqueenvillian,10/07/2020,4 Stars,"I liked the meditation and I think it will help a lot people who are struggling right now.
Only thing that might make it even better is maybe soft soothing music in background."
Love Love Love,poponguavhsibf hwvjsknfi,10/06/2020,5 Stars,"It‚Äôs like sitting across from Anthony William and listening to him talk. He unveils important information that we should all know so we can protect ourselves and our loved ones. I love this podcast format because it supplements his books and all the real life success stories he shares on Instagram. I put on my headphones and walk and listen and learn. Protecting nature is also important to me and all of these topics he covers shows the harm that is being done to all living things. Maybe if enough of us listen, believe and join together in this movement, we will see real change. I don‚Äôt know where I would be without Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion - honestly... Sending my gratitude"

Focus on the info! And Heal!,averagebetty,10/05/2020,5 Stars,"I first started reading Anthony‚Äôs books when I was having an increase in symptoms such as chemical sensitivity, food sensitivities, rashes (eczema), vertigo and ongoing heart palpitations . I had already been to plenty of doctors that didn‚Äôt have effective treatments, just drugs.    
Having an open mind was helpful and I was able to see my symptoms were related and that I could HEAL!
Try to see Anthony is the messenger, so put your focus on the information, not the messenger.... Even though I think he‚Äôs GREAT! ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
Put your big girl pants on!,ruby 2day,10/04/2020,5 Stars,"Every episode reveals difficult to swallow truths that we all sort of know in a collective unconscious sort of way.

Anthony William has helped heal my diabetes and fatty liver syndrome.. 

I have been meditating for over 25 years, the moon meditation is deeply healing and intense it even gave me additional healing the next day!"

I love Anthony and he is truly a gift from God."
Thank you Anthony!,PearlJen401,10/04/2020,5 Stars,I soooooooo needed to hear this!
Brain Meditation - no words can describe....,Marice S,10/04/2020,5 Stars,"The brain meditation is out of this world!!! I can‚Äôt believe how much better I feel.

This is my first review and sharing of my experience so I apologize for its length:

Years ago I spent a year doing Entrainment Meditation which altered my brain in a way that changed how my body functioned.  I developed anxiety, depression, depersonalization and insomnia.  Thoughts and fears overtook me and my body felt old, brittle and I experienced indescribable fatigue daily.  No one understood this as I appeared ‚Äònormal‚Äô and/or healthy to most.  After doing AW‚Äôs meditation twice a day since it‚Äôs release, I feel in sync and integrated.  I know the feeling of separation between body/brain, spirit/body and spirit/brain.  What AW describes is spot on.  That separation is at best extremely uncomfortable and at worst, disabling and terrifying.  This meditation has brought my soul the relief it has been aching for for so long!!!!

My Health Journey:

In my 12th year of managing neurological symptoms with nutrition and alternative treatments, still barely surviving on fumes and feeling I would probably never fully recover my health, I received a Lyme diagnosis.  A couple of months later, a friend told me about MM.  I borrowed the first book from her and haven‚Äôt looked elsewhere for answers since.  I voraciously consumed all of AW‚Äôs radio shows and books, becoming somewhat obsessed.  Finally, a light had come along to shine on 10+ years of confusion and searching.  AW has brought clarity to all of my symptoms and helped me realize where some of my seemingly healthy practices were setting me back.  Over the past year, I‚Äôve strictly followed most recommendations: daily celery juice, lemon water, fresh aloe, morning cleanse, heavy metal and liver detox smoothies, eliminating eggs, gluten, dairy, corn, soy and eating Lots and Lots of FRUIT (yes, fruit fear is a thing - I had it) and as a result reduced my symptoms to about 80 percent.  After listening to the brain meditation, I now feel like my old self again.  That last bit of bloat, mental fatigue, depersonalization and sense of disconnect are resolving.  After all the time and money I‚Äôve put in over the years to only feel subpar, it absolutely blows me away that someone is offering this incredibly powerful health restoring information for FREE!  There is no one else out there like him.  Thank you AW!  You really are the embodiment of compassion üß°üôèüß°"
Medical medium caffeine podcast,4HEALTH224,10/04/2020,5 Stars,Excellent podcast with the information that I was partially expecting when I was searching for the truth 12 years ago. Still trying to recover from all of that caffeine I consumed from my 40‚Äôs to 50‚Äôs. So glad to be without it but it takes a toll on the skin and hair. Thank you Anthony William

Excellent,artfire33,10/03/2020,5 Stars,"As difficult as these truths are to hear and to get your mind around, we need to hear them so we can make the best choices not only for our personal health, but for the planet too. I‚Äôm sad there is such evil but there‚Äôs a lot of love too...we just need to get to that tipping point where the idea that there‚Äôs enough for everyone prevails."
Medical Medium Blows my mind with his knowledge and accuracy,Yflorida,10/03/2020,5 Stars,"After discovering Antony Williams, I stoped listening and following all of those ‚ÄúLegit‚Äù holistic doctors, MD doctors homeopaths. All holistic doctors out there  just misleading me for many years with their new diets, sublime taste, studies, researched etc..... Medical Medium makes the most sense to me of all. I wish I could discover this guy earlier but still very thankful I found him. It‚Äôs an eye opening for me on so many things. Drinking celery juice is part of my morning routine now. I love his podcasts and his books. Thank you Anthony for all your work you do for us to help us heal! God Bless"

Snake oil salesman,MrChristopher503,10/02/2020,1 Star,"This guy is a snake-oil salesman with no actual medical training. Please do your research of this guy. I was blocked from their Instagram page for asking what his medical training is.

Life Saving Information,Ixtlaly,10/01/2020,5 Stars,"I am so grateful for the information I have heard from the Medical Medium! It has changed my life. There have been so many symptoms I have removed from my life because of celery juice and all his information of other healing foods, such as sciatica pain, brittle nails, and knee pain. I have cancer and found out the link between heavy metals and viruses as a cause for cancer. I‚Äôm still healing, but I know with Medical Medium protocols and cleanses that I can remove all my symptoms and heal from cancer. Thank you so much Anthony! üíì‚ú®"
Love this new podcast!!,Reggaeton4,10/01/2020,5 Stars,"Thank you! I love the guided meditations, they‚Äôre easy to follow and peaceful. I also love the new information you provide to us.

Medicine/science has no answers for autoimmune/chronic illness,goody2sho,10/01/2020,5 Stars,"For anyone stating this Medical Medium is not a doctor, no surprise!!‚Äô He states that right away in his first book !  Why is that a problem...Seems like ALL feel Bill Gates can dictate our need for vaccines globally and HE IS NOT A DOCTOR...and this Bill Gates has harmed many by his vaccine trials in other countries!  Comments here say the Spirit is of evil!?!?! Well you all better look at Bill  Gates...he practices satanism! 
The Medical Medium is given advanced medical information from the Spirit!  He is a human being that has taken on the responsibility to inform the masses of chronically ill with common sense answers and protocols to heal!  !  I AM ONE OF THEM!  AW may not be the best speaker and as for podcasts...everybody‚Äôs podcasts over the years I have listened to are too long and could get their message across in 15 minutes...everyone of podcasts are long winded!  
As far as the Spirit is a cast away...evil...loner...I will and have read and taken his advice for my health issues of 60+ years! Makes sense for the whys and has helped me tremendously!  40+ years doctoring with conventional and alternative was a waste of time...used my insurance and drugs prescribed caused side effects...nothing resolved!  I have answers to my ills as a child and why me health suffered the remaining years! I have various tests that prove of parasites, heavy metals, EPV, streptococcus, mold!  Our health agencies, science, medicine are corrupt!  And the proof is in the pudding!  Science discredits anything natural as it is unpatentable...no money to be made by pharma!  So obvious with this coronavirus...right from the start science was damning colloidal silver...and the list goes on to avoiding anything natural to improve the immune system!  Even drugs like hydroxychloroquine is damned...because of the push for vaccines...a patentable..money making product!  
The MM gives protocols to safely detox, heal and improve the immune system!  A total win-win! 
For you hard core science believers, and do not believe in God...this AW is a stretch!  But so was Edgar Cayce...science could not give answers to Cayce‚Äôs accurate diagnosis‚Äôs and healings! Cayce was a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù who could diagnose and treat the ill back in the late 1800‚Äôs when going into a trance, he was noted for the castor oil packs!  NATURAL remedies that worked! There was no evil from this medium!! AND SCIENCE COUKD NOT GIVE SNSWER TO HIS ACCURACY...all got pushed under the rug...because natural remedies were damned as pharma controlled medicine was to be taught only in the colleges!  The brainwashing continues! But industrialization messed with our immune systems...our health , corrupt scientists biased studies, deceit about toxins, how viruses were created in labs, medicines ignorance for better testing, acknowledgment of mutated viruses, bacteria, heavy metals.... ALL IN THE NAME OF GREED..corporatization of our government! 
If you want perfectionism in his speaking ability...let‚Äôs look at our POTUS!  Even Obama was an exceptional speaker of intelligence!  Our POTUS is a very uneducated speaker! AW is not a college student, has been working with this Spirit since a child‚Äô. Is doing his best! Yes, there could be room for improvement! We ALL need improvements and should look at yourselves also! 
I have been to many, many specialists for my ills over the years....and not impressed with their so called educated diagnoses or treatments!  Many were rude and reckless!  Some were compassionate to run a ton of tests...nothing to resolve or give answers...just kept prescribing one drug after another or worthless diets!  So I have the bad experiences that led me the MM, to see the truth and recognize the common sense answers to give answers to all my health issues since birth!!!! 
So I do not feel this Spirit is evil...or the MM a scam, a cult...NOT one bit!  No push to pray to a god of his creation...no drugs to sell of his creation!  Yes he advises to purchase his book...but still is enough free info on the internet!  I used my library for his books...didn‚Äôt cost me a dime!  In past supplements(poor quality, bad ingredients)  suggested by doctors/programs caused me ills that sent me to the ER... to now have the ‚Äúoption‚Äù to choose quality supplements the MM recommends that I have used for 2 years...and no ER...are working!  My last test showed I am free of parasites, no heavy metals or EPV.  Still have streptococcus, and mold.  But also healed low blood pressure, dry eye syndrome, eczema and painful reflux/ indigestion ALL without drugs! Just plain following the MM protocols!  
Be stubborn people...you can keep the Big Pharma/corrupt science happy with their brainwashing your mind with false promises ...drug after drug...vaccine after vaccine! No answers to the whys of disease...chronic illness! ! My bet is with God...with the MM as my guide! It is a free country yet to choose what I put in my body!  Our health agencies, science, medicine do not care about health...they care about their billions! Censorship is not if a free country!   Elite control will end this world by their senseless deterioration of our environment,  along with the death of our body‚Äôs environment! I pray for this world of unbelievers and believers in science! üôè"
Eggs: eaters loose all!,Love&light19,10/01/2020,1 Star,By far my favorite and most powerful podcast I‚Äôve listened to yet. The chemtrails for me was a tough one to handle because in the end I still felt powerless. Eggs is equally upsetting but man I walked away from that podcast feeling empowered! Thank you Anthony William for all that you do. LOVING the podcasts!
Incredible information,Mona Diaz Barros,10/01/2020,5 Stars,"Absolutely love the show. So grateful to have found the Medical Medium information. It has saved my life. I use the books as consultation everyday and they help me every day as well as all the information you put out there with so much effort. I do not miss every podcast you upload and listen to them more than one time and share as much as I can.

"Saving My Life, I‚Äôm Home!",pheonix zin,09/30/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William, Medical Medium information is helping me heal, giving me hope and continue to blow my mind away daily. I got very sick with multiple symptoms and while I was loosing hope, my girl friend who also is sick told me about Anthony. Having been on the confusing health journey for over 12 years, I am finally HOME now with Medical Medium. AW‚Äôs informations have completely changed my life for the better. I bought all of his books, shared ‚ÄúCleanse To Heal Book‚Äù with everyone I come in contact with. I buy the book for them! I am forever thankful of AW and I pray for him everyday.

Fantastic,hdkcmjxoak,09/29/2020,5 Stars,Amazing podcast. Love the content!
EGGSactly!! Brilliant Delivery,melijala,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"This egg episode got into the nitty gritty that I‚Äôve been curious to know about. I love history lessons.  This explanation is complete and makes sense.  I loved the deeper look into the exact process from the blood with mercury, to the variety of foods stuff used to try to grow pathogens.  
I loved the scientific explanation and the delivery was spot on almost soft like being spoon fed the information gently, but not  in a condescending manner.  Eggs have been used for a variety of artistic mediums as well as for science.  Tempera paints, photography prints, and even vaccines have had constituents.  If I need to make sugar skulls I use sugar and dried egg whites.  You can tarnish silver with an hardboiled egg, especially the whites. The shell can been softened to a thin balloon membrane in vinegar.  Here‚Äôs the thing.  The incredible edible egg was compromised. It is tragic really. Thank you AW and SOC for a great podcast. I liked the poetic puns at the ending."
So important,Axe Gold,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"I am so grateful that Anthony exists and that he is shedding light on this little known and critical information, in this era of rampant chronic/mystery illnesses. As a highly sensitive person, I can't thank him enough for his work - we need voices like his as a beacon of truth in the midst of so much false rhetoric from mainstream medicine."
Eggs,Moonfiere,09/29/2020,5 Stars,Finally I found the answers to restore my health. The best part besides regaining your health is that you do lose your desire for eggs and your palate discovers all kinds of wonderful new foods. Thank you Anthony Williams. I just wish I heard of you sooner!

Every episode contains life saving information!!,Khashoggi,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"I learn SO much with each podcast and SoundCloud episode. The information is not only life saving, but THE most advanced health information available today. I have healed stage 1 colon cancer, itching burning skin, tinnitus, jaw pain, chronic fatigue, eye floaters, weight gain, migraines, adrenal fatigue, insomnia, brain fog, and my daughter is healing chronic acne. I have been using MM info for almost 4 years now. Traditional western medicine AND Chinese medicine did not have answers. The only way I‚Äôve even able to feel like I‚Äôm 25 at 48 years old, to be healed, and to be able to exercise again is by reading the books, watching the webinars and podcasts, and actually implementing this information into my life. I am forever grateful to be given a new lease on life. I am at this amazing state of health because of Anthony Williams and Spirit. They are a gift to humanity. Forever blessed. üôèüôèüôè"

This is my language; this is the truth; this is what I believe in. And for those who are not spiritual, this is science and it‚Äôs ok because spirituality can be left for those who want it. In other words God created the sun for all. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
not your ordinary front desk girl,NoelShepar,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"Without a doubt these are the best podcasts on health, wellness and enpowerment out there!! His compassion and dedication to sharing his knowledge is exactly what the world needs right now. What a blessing this information is! Thank you Anthony."
Great podcasts & information- it works!,nicki babyy<3,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony is getting so much better at podcasts - much more succinct & to the point than his previous radio shows years past on SoundCloud. These podcasts are packed with helpful information and presented in such a way that really grabs your attention. I have been following the info in his books for over a year and have completely reversed my chronic acid reflux, brain fog, headaches, unexplained hives, seasonal allergies, gastritis, emotional struggles, anxiety and more - that over 15 doctors and practitioners couldn‚Äôt help me with. I continue to heal some of my last standing symptoms and am finally feeling ALIVE again. This information works, and I can feel that it‚Äôs the truth - spread with good intentions against the sinister profit driven industries that want to keep us sick. Keep an open mind and think critically. You‚Äôll start to connect the dots."
Excellent info! However...,ricebowlhaircut,09/29/2020,4 Stars,"... this new intro is super cheesy, like a reality tv show or religious cult program (think Bachelor, Survivor, etc). And the closing poetry, is awkward, like he‚Äôs trying to rap.

Love AW for sharing this info! Info is valuable so don‚Äôt let this review deter you. However, the producer should create something better suited to AW‚Äôs down to earth style."
I Love You,InfinityWellnessNJ,09/29/2020,5 Stars,"My heart knows the message of this man stands high above the rest. So many people are a mouthpiece, consciously or unconsciously, for the dark. Anthony William is different, he speaks with YOUR interest in mind, he actually cares about YOU. Give a long hard reflection on the truths this man shares. Everything he puts out is for your well being! My life improves drastically every time I incorporate something he shares. And I am no newbie to the health arena. I‚Äôve done so many other health practices over the years, and in my experience, nothing compares."
Heartfelt compassion!,Crisdalc,09/29/2020,5 Stars,Antony Williams and Spirit of compassion are transforming my life and millions of other life‚Äôs with his information! I am eternally grateful and I truly appreciate his passion for helping us all!

Fruit Fear,HenpeckPond,09/29/2020,1 Star,What? Who says fruit is bad? What is with the scare tactics? Bizarre delivery. What are your credentials? First and last listen.
Killing you Smelly,OjwR7x0=#@,09/28/2020,5 Stars,Please talk about how toxic the laundry detergents are.  They smell really bad and super strong.  Please mention them in your podcast so people know not to poison themselves with the laundry detergents.
Awesome.,jcdcsc,09/28/2020,5 Stars,"This is the Real Deal folks. I‚Äôve studied health and nutrition since 2009, and and Medical Medium is the best information on health and nutrition, hands down, no contest. The only other information that come close is from Dr McDougall, due to the emphasis on carbohydrates. However, there is nothing else that even comes close to the thorough, comprehensive, expansive information brought to us from Anthony and Spirit. This is knowledge for today, and tomorrow, to keep us healthy in these modern times we live in. Thank God."
Who is a fruit demonizer?,Alternative Health Chick,09/28/2020,1 Star,"Firstly, just because someone repeats the same words again and again doesn‚Äôt make something true. Secondly, who are these fruit demonizes that Anthony speaks of? As with ANYTHING, you can have too much of a good thing. Dentists are not blaming fruit for cavities. As a long time healthcare practitioner, I‚Äôve not told patients to stop eating fruit. Yes, the paleo diet does. Yes, the Atkins diet does. However, people need to research which of these two was actually created by a doctor and for what purpose. 
I tried listening to another podcast, but found the repetition to be too much to finish."
I always enjoy the Medical Medium,Allurajai,09/28/2020,5 Stars,"I love to listen to Anthony William‚Äôs information, wisdom, really. The Fear meditation was lovely and he‚Äôs bringing new information that, even if I‚Äôve heard some things before, he‚Äôs bringing it from his own experience,"

Killing you Smelly!,Lynn Foutch,09/27/2020,5 Stars,"Another critical, life saving episode packed with truth!

Also, can you imagine many women had their legs amputated secondary to a radiation machine to measure their foot back in the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs?  Unbelievable!  Thank you Anthony and Spirit...the truths are truly a game changer and critical to protect your life!"

That‚Äôs the difference!"
"Read the Books, Ditch the New Podcast",NemsCo,09/26/2020,3 Stars,"I agree with the review Fazerless wrote 100%. I‚Äôve had life changing experiences with the Medical Medium info since following it in 2017‚Äîdecrease in depression, binge eating, acne, eczema, mystery aches and pains, mood swings‚Äîincrease in energy, digestion, and overall happiness.

I truly believe Anthony William is passing on info from Spirit of Compassion. I don‚Äôt need medical citations or research to back up this knowledge. I believe it‚Äôs truth from a divine source. With that being said, I find the podcast annoying, and if this was my intro to MM, I wouldn‚Äôt believe any of it. The intro and closing music is dramatic, and he sounds like a car salesman, but he‚Äôs not. He needs to fire his producer. My recommendation?

1) follow him on Instagram and read all the amazing knowledge and experiences from people healing around the world 
2) read book #1 Medical Medium - so you understand his back story
3) read Cleanse to Heal - it‚Äôs packed with everything you learn in the previous books but more concise and more action packed with cleanses 
4) listen to his old podcasts on Sound Cloud - he still rambles but at least he sounds genuine 
5) if you feel overwhelmed and don‚Äôt know where to start, drink lemon water first thing. That‚Äôs all I did for a year and eventually the other recommendations followed. 

Thanks Anthony for continuing to put yourself out there. I write my review from a place of love because I appreciate you and want more people to be receptive to your knowledgeüíïüíï"

Try it or deny it and live in the dark,HailBug1234,09/25/2020,5 Stars,"I owe my life to this information. Anthony gave my life back to me. In 2017 life was not worth living as my health took a severe turn for the worse‚Äî 54 symptoms weighing me down to the point I lost myself completely. The depression, anxiety, and fatigue were the absolute worst part of my symptoms. I could hardly rise out of bed and when I did my depression and anxiety further prevented me from living my life. To the doubters‚Äî try it long term with as much dedication as you possibly can or keep on denying it. Those who have healed will never stop speaking about what we have experienced. We know the truth. You do not. You deny it with out ever have truly connected with it through experiencing it. But one day you will need it. Thank you MM! Thank you God for hearing the cries of the chronically ill who never had a chance in this world with out you. You have given us back our free will to exist on this planet in a way worth living. I‚Äôll never stop speaking about what you have done for me."
Saved my life,Gustavo R.T.,09/25/2020,5 Stars,"Symptoms keep lessening and going away Thanks to Anthony and Spirit of compassion. At one point I tough I was going to die and leave my 3 little ones and wife, kept telling my self at night that they will be ok without me (that‚Äôs the hardest part). But now drinking 32oz of celery juice and Following the no food list and listening to all the radio show pop cast that give me hope everyday I‚Äôm raising out of the ashes and felling stronger every day and now starting the heavy metal smoothie and 28 day cleanse to get to the next level.

I can truly say that for the past 4 years my only source for answers with ANY health questions are in Anthony‚Äôs books, radio shows, lives on Instagram, and his website. 
I own every single book and have read every single page on all his books. Each and every single one amazes me.

Better advice than from ‚Äúactual doctors‚Äù,JosefinaBrito,09/24/2020,5 Stars,"Complete honesty and genuine care to help others get better.  Love his transparency, courage and eagerness to make us healthy and fight against society‚Äôs addiction to pharmaceuticals that only make us feel worse, deter our health and bodies and make us dependent on their drugs at the expense of out health just for profit.

Cured all my health problems,health12345,09/24/2020,5 Stars,"Over the course of 5 years I had seen several doctors for my stomach pain and problems that I suffered with throughout college. Finally after 5 years I was able to get a diagnosis of gastroparesis, which is a rare condition. The doctors put me on a strict diet with limited fruits and no raw vegetables allowed. I became really thin and felt malnourished. My stomach pain was gone but my acid reflux worsened. Finally, a friend convinced me to try celery juice. For the first time in years, after 16 ounces of celery juice, I experienced little to no acid reflux afterwards. Fast forward a year and a half after following medical medium protocols (including celery juice every AM), I am stronger and eating more fruits and vegetables than ever and all my acid reflux/stomach problems are gone! After you experience a mystery illness and the doctors can‚Äôt even fix you after different diagnoses and medication that doesn‚Äôt work (and only worsens your condition), you will understand that he speaks the truth. So thankful for this information thank you Anthony William!"
Fruit fear,Jswano613,09/24/2020,1 Star,"Who started fruit fear? If you want to have this discussion you need to have transparency! You need to cite resources! I think Americans are eating way more fruit than ever before and they‚Äôre eating that instead of vegetables. Also Americans are eating way too much bread pasta and highly processed chips etc. but there add to the excess sugar intake from junk food with fruit as well. Studies have who‚Äôs too much fructose is deadly. Of course high-fructose corn syrup is the main issue. But, we can not just feed our children bread and fruit! Try eating fish and broccoli and spinach and almonds. You will be healthy! Eating fruit can be healthy. But, it shouldn‚Äôt be in the same category as veggies. Fruit is not evil. Apples are great! But, the ones breed to be huge and extra sweet aren‚Äôt as good as the real wild apples."
Powerful Meditation! Thank you!,healining2020,09/24/2020,5 Stars,"Thank you for the soul healing meditation!  This was the missing link to my healing. They say your eyes are a glimpse into your soul. I‚Äôm a believer!

To give you some background on me. These past few years I really started to notice my eyes in the mirror and in photographs. Something had changed or was missing. There‚Äôs this emptiness in my facial expression. Mainly in my eyes.  

Just last week my daughter pointed out that I no longer know how to smile in photos. Which was not the case prior. I was extremely photogenic. I loved being photographed. I‚Äôm guilty of taking  way too many selfies. I use to be called ‚ÄúBarbie Mom‚Äù by my daughters friends. You get the idea.

All that has change. I avoid photos. I don‚Äôt enjoy looking in the mirror anymore. After doing this meditation, now I know why.  I had some soul healing I needed to work on. 

When I saw my reflection, I was able to see all my past pain in my eyes. All my sadness in my eyes. All my disappointment in my eyes.

*** I had to pause while I wrote this review. After writing about my pain in the last sentence above, the tears started to flow. Then I began to cry. I instantly felt a lifetime of pain, sadness and disappointment. It was overwhelming. I cried hard. 

While crying, I still held my phone in my hand as I was determined to finish writing this review. Then my screen turned off.  The lighting was perfect. While still crying, I saw my reflection on my phone screen. I saw the tears running down my face. I saw & felt all the pain, sadness and disappointment I had experience throughout my lifetime. I felt sorry for my reflection. 

Then there was a shift in my energy. I felt compelled to soothe that reflection of myself I saw on my phone. I started saying out loud:  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ok. You made it. You‚Äôre a good mom. You‚Äôre strong. You can do it‚Äù. 

Then there was another shift in me. I slowly started to smile. As I saw my smiling reflection on my phone I began to feel good. Feel lighter. Feel free. I smiled more and more. I even laughed out loud.

Then came the final shift. I began to praise my reflection out loud:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok. I made it. I‚Äôm a good mom. I‚Äôm strong. I did it.‚Äù   

I went from saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre to I‚Äôm.  It was right then, I had reconnected to my soul. I‚Äôm healing. I had stopped believing in myself. I stopped focusing on my happiness and my desires. I had let my pain & disappointment lead the way and influence me.

While still holding my phone, I stared at my reflection and focused in on my eyes.  I wanted to speak directly to my soul.  I said ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù.  

I then looked to the right and thanked my dog, Simba. Who was sitting on the couch next to me. I then thanked my family. Especially my parents. Then my friends. The birds. All the animals. The trees and beautiful planet earth. I then looked up while feeling really good, I saw a beautiful red cardinal fly past my window. I love birds. Did you know they sing to the Angels? 

Anthony and Spirit of Compassion, thank you.  I found your Instagram account in 2018.  Since then, I read all your books. Listened to your radio show and podcasts.  I talk to the Angels you mention in your books.  I believe Angel of Mercy saved my mom‚Äôs life. That‚Äôs a story in itself.

I‚Äôve healed many chronic symptoms. I live The Medical Medium Way. It‚Äôs a daily lifestyle that will last throughout my lifetime. 

You and SOC are spiritual members in our household. Not a day goes by that your names aren‚Äôt mentioned.  Thank you.‚ú®

*** If you hadn‚Äôt listen to the meditation podcast, it may be best not to read this next part. I want you to have an organic experience. Stop here.

***

At the end of the meditation, when the voice is calling for me to take the final step forward and cross the hole in the bridge ... is when the magic occurred for me.

When I crossed the hole in the bridge and saw that it was me calling to myself this entire time, my body was pulled forward into myself (soul) standing in front of me at the end of the bridge. 

It wasn‚Äôt just a visual of myself going into my soul. I felt my body get sucked in.  It was a force. It was an amazing experience that I‚Äôll never forget. üíó

Thank you & God Bless‚ú®

It's been three years, and I've still got a long way to go with my chronic illnesses and these podcasts are already helping me get there quicker.

Thank you for the Truth!,@HealingWithSpirit,09/24/2020,5 Stars,"Thank you AW for sharing the truth and spending your own money and time to get it to people like me, the chronically ill, that need it so desperately! 
You are a bright light shining like a lighthouse in the darkness of ignorance and deviousness.  You ask nothing in return from us, only that we believe that WE CAN HEAL, and that we share that truth with others that need it.
AW, I feel your compassion for us, and I‚Äôm so grateful for you and Spirit of the Most High, and your willingness to share your gift with us even though it has never been easy for you.
I‚Äôm still on my healing journey, but the information you share has helped me heal a huge amount already, and renewed my hope when I had almost given up.  The results I‚Äôve already had and the compassionate words you have spoken again and again have brought me back from thoughts of suicide because my pain and suffering has been so bad I‚Äôve felt like I couldn‚Äôt bare it any longer.
Thank you for saying the reason I‚Äôm sick is not my fault, you don‚Äôt know how much those words have helped me and have made me cry with gratitude and self-forgivness, that I could stop blaming myself and my body.
You are so strong to do what you do, and I might not still be alive without your strength to keep going and get this healing information out there.
With much love for you and Spirit,

mind blowing information,Life6435,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony Williams is completely uncensored in this podcast. He reveals mind blowing information, telling us the truth to what we are all up against I've listened to Anthony for years, he has completely healed my stage 4 EBV, shingles, strep, IBS, etc, but here Anthony also touches on those spiritual questions we all want to know 2! it's not scary to me, but very empowering! Can't wait for the brain meditation episode!"

Empower Yourself to Heal,Candlechic,09/23/2020,5 Stars,AW and his information is a gift that shines light into the darkness. I will be forever grateful for Anthony‚Äôs willingness to step up and help those of us who are willing to receive his message with love & gratitude.

If you have anything that is less than perfect in your life, to a debilitating deadly disease, then this is the only way! I have been in healthcare for over 20 years and unfortunately the great doctors just don‚Äôt have the information, tools, or knowledge to do what they need to do! Ask them! They want to heal but they don‚Äôt know how! His information can be reached for free but do yourself a favor and get all if the books! They are encyclopedias for life and how to heal when everything else has failed!  Start with the latest CLEANSE TO HEAL you won‚Äôt be disappointed! This is untainted information and here on Apple is the only way you won‚Äôt hear the ‚ÄúEDITED‚Äù version! Thank you Apple for giving us this as is!!!! Even more hyped on Apple for this!!!"

Incites Fear rather than Love and Healing,s.love9,09/23/2020,1 Star,"I have used and enjoyed a number of Anthony‚Äôs medical healing protocols however the nature of this podcast has taken a turn and is quite alarming. Particularly regarding the one on chem trails. 

There is an attempt to spark fear and choose sides with talk of a spiritual war. The fear mongering is reminiscent of FOX news. Just because you‚Äôve had success with Anthonys protocols in your health, PLEASE do not follow Anthony blindly without doing additional research, particularly on issues outside of his purview."
Thank you for all you do for us!,Nbazeri,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"This information is so powerful. It is incredible and shocking to hear all the stories around the world of millions of people healing because of Anthony‚Äôs devine information. I cannot wait to introduce more friends and family to this podcast. Thank you for all the hours and hard work you put into this, Anthony. Words cannot express how much I appreciate it and will forever follow your advice!"
A higher power indeed üôè,Apleck,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"The truth is very hard to take, in any form and what Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion are doing for the planet and humanity is unheard of. They have no ego and they truly want to help. His podcasts are unlike any other information you will ever receive. When you are awakened, you will actually absorb the information and not mock it! This is the truth, They are the truth, a higher power guiding them to guide us. Love them both and every day I‚Äôm thankful for them. We can only heal with these tools if we share the knowledge and truth he is telling us. Thank you AW and SOC for your üíï love!"
Life Saving Information!!,Bethany1013,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"Never mind the few bad reviews here.  They are written by people who are either not part of the chronically ill community or they are paid to troll Anthony William and try and discredit his information that has healed and is healing millions.  I am one of those hopeless chronically ill people that Anthony William has saved.  I was in horrible pain for many years and countless doctors in the mainstream and alternative medical systems were at best no help at all and at worst causing severe trauma and harm.  Despite being a health food nut, marathoner, powerlifter, meditator, and yoga enthusiast, I was left trying to accept the idea that I would be in pain forever.  Sciatic pain, chronic fatigue, severe digestive problems, food sensitivities, burning mouth syndrome, hair loss, jaundice, multiple chemical sensitivities, MCAS, obesity, edema, cystic acne, depression, anxiety, and eczema are just a few of the conditions that I dealt with on a daily basis.  Then I found the Medical Medium information and that changed everything.  I started to slowly recover from conditions I was told by doctors that I would live with forever.  My healing journey is not over, but I finally know that I WILL HEAL.  The information that AW gives in his podcast, similar to his books, blog, and social media live streams, is revolutionary and from the purest source.  This is AW's first completely uncensored podcast and each episode that has come out so far is jam-packed with healing TRUTH.  If you want to heal or want to help someone else heal, then this is the place to be.  I wish I could give 10 stars!"
You are a blessing to this world,chathu25,09/23/2020,5 Stars,Scary but an eye opening massage. Thank you Anthony. I bought your all books and started to read the first one.
Life-changing for anyone suffering!,the naked food life,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"After over a decade of being chronically ill with no answers, Anthony's genuine teachings are the first advice that's actually helping me heal, and I know in my soul that this information is authentic. We are only human, and although many doctors have good intentions they only know what they've been taught and there is so much biased profit-driven information, ""cures,"" testing, and medications that it's impossible to trust anyone or anything associated with the healthcare industry!"
Medical Medium - Messenger of Truth,DDay011,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"Although I am not someone who usually writes reviews, I want to take the time to do so for the Medical Medium. Anthony and Spirit have truly changed my life and the lives of so many of my friends and family. There‚Äôs so much out there in the world that we are up against, but with Anthony and Spirit on our side, we know we have a fighting chance. Thank you MM for not giving up on your journey in order to be a messenger of truth, to banish darkness with the light, and to help ease the suffering of millions around the world. The information you share is priceless- my family and I feel so blessed to have you be a part of our daily lives in the form of all the healing protocols we implement and the spiritual strength we draw from the compassion you and Spirit have shown us. My TRUTH is I wouldn‚Äôt be here today without you and Spirit, I am empowered & inspired by you and Spirit, and I won‚Äôt give up on my healing journey because I have you and Spirit. I love you Spirit and Anthony, and thank you for loving me!"

Truths the sick industry don‚Äôt want you to know,Doubleclutch229,09/23/2020,5 Stars,"I‚Äôve been following Anthony and Medical Medium for a few years now, and have found his perspectives filled with wisdom and little know truths.  Much of it is common sense that when know or knew at some point.  For me eating fruits and veggies hasn‚Äôt been difficult, and I‚Äôm always interested to know about benefits of fruit and veggies I regularly consume.  Highly recommend if you are tired or struggling with ‚Äúconsensus diets!‚Äù"

Wow!,Azaleea1,09/22/2020,1 Star,"I am speechless after listening to one of his podcasts today. There is no reference to any medical studies or research.

The Real Deal,Cubanita in the bay,09/22/2020,5 Stars,I have read Anthony‚Äôs books and followed his protocols on and off for several years. I have slowly started to reduce my hypothyroidism and I have reversed many other emotional issues. A lot of what he talks about is completely logical like fruit being good for us. I‚Äôd rather eat something from the Earth than a lab. I would be skeptical of anyone that advocates his teachings shouldn‚Äôt be followed. If you do research you‚Äôll see how much money is behind the industries that pay for studies to promote ‚Äúwell being‚Äù .. Look at a line at Starbucks and ask yourself if that‚Äôs an industry you would trust. One that has people addicted into paying $5 or more every day... We are addicted to the things that make us sick and not by choice.
He‚Äôs the only...,magnolia28012570,09/22/2020,5 Stars,"Man on earth who can heal you.  Really, honest to goodness heal you.  I‚Äôm in the process of healing after a year of being on his protocols.  I likely would‚Äôve healed sooner if I didn‚Äôt cheat on take out foods (hard to get fresh foods prepared for me).  I‚Äôve been sick for 10 years with MS.  Stuck on mattress island for four of those.  Last year, I thought I was knocking on death‚Äôs door and then the lady from the funeral home who came to the house to help me plan for my funeral told me about his first book.  Her boss praised it and had a family member change their life completely around from a terminal Illness.  I bought it and read it wide-eyed, crying and mouth open much of the time.  I‚Äôll never question God‚Äôs word through the Bible or now through these books.  Or his podcasts.  A lot of this is sad info but so important to know because so many in the world aren‚Äôt looking out for us like they should.  Many ill-intentioned souls exist which is disheartening.  But Anthony isn‚Äôt.  He genuinely cares for those of us who are sick.  He‚Äôs going to every length to help us and he‚Äôs got so many people against him. So please, if you‚Äôve been healed by him or are in the process of healing, or just feeling a little better after trying his protocols, give him the credit he deserves.  I‚Äôm not completely healed but I know I will be in the next year or so if I stick to his teachings and advice.  Take up for him because he takes up for us.  BTW, ALL of his podcasts/radio shows are unparalleled.  You‚Äôll hopefully feel relieved after listening to what he has to say üëçüèº"

Come on.. your memory is so malleable as a child, especially a young child. He could have overheard parents talking about how it might be lung cancer because of whatever reason.

"Completely Priceless info, public speaking not one of his gifts.",Fazerless,09/22/2020,4 Stars,"I read his book Medical Medium in 2016 and it personally changed my life. He won MY trust the day I read page 47.  He started to describe the progression of the illness at stage four. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was reading. After a lifetime of doctors not knowing what was happening to me This guy literally knew blow-by-blow what, how and why and it was right there on the pages in front of me. I have never been able to describe my own symptoms it so concisely to any physician as he did on that page. Sobbing I jotted down the dates in the margin that each stage had happened to me.  No doctor has ever had any amount of knowledge even touching this mans insight and I‚Äôve been to so many in my lifetime of CFS hell, spending a fortune in multiple states and countries. I‚Äôm forever grateful this man is in the world.
The bottom line is since 2016 I continue to improve using his book and podcast advice.I sure wish I could get an appointment with him.

If he were my friend I would advise him, to minimize further criticism I‚Äôve read from others,
A) He needs a better editor or a ghost writer of sorts to help clean up his rambling style at least that was my first thought upon reading his first book. They may have gotten better and they are so visually beautiful. 
B) He needs a gifted speaking coach that he trusts because OMG, he‚Äôs just awful, my heart breaks for him and I can‚Äôt recommend him to my friends Because I feel like ‚ÄúI get him‚Äù where they would not. These are friends who may or may not even believe I was ever ill because the doctors couldn‚Äôt figure it out. A very common problem in the world of the mysteriously chronically ill.

For his neigh sayers and for those familiar with the enneagram, I believe he‚Äôs a 6 on the enneagram as most great psychics are, poor guy is under so much stress he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone to 3‚Äù and he comes off looking like a scheming sales person when really he‚Äôs nothing of the sort. That‚Äôs why he looks so defensive.

 He mentioned he started writing books after his waiting list was over 1 million people. He had about 3 million on Facebook last I looked. He didn‚Äôt really want to write books he just wanted to do the one on one that he loves. He has so many celebrities as clients he can‚Äôt lack for money and he doesn‚Äôt really need to do this work that he‚Äôs doing now.  He‚Äôs trying to save millions of suffering people and nothing short of that. It‚Äôs out of his compassion. And spirit is on his butt. He does have an ego, but who doesn‚Äôt. If I had his gift, I don‚Äôt know how I would keep it together.
Thank you Lord for Anthony William and Spirit of Compassion. Hang in there Anthony."

My Walking Jesus üôèüèª,Rainey02,09/22/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William gave me the information I needed to save my life when the doctors told me they couldn‚Äôt. Here is the bottom line for all of the nay sayers comments I have read so far.... None of them so I‚Äôve read, have been a victim of disease and have suffered, nor gone through the let down after let down by doctors, and been taken advantage of and poked and probed and in and out of the hospital. Until you are living walking proof like myself, it‚Äôs just your opinion. I can say with the utmost certainty that Anthony William is the real deal. I have my life back because of his knowledge, AND MY APPLICATION OF IT. If you are really sick, and want to heal then buy the books and read them yourself. STOP COMPLAINING. Or continue to be sick. Your choice. There is no person I trust with health information other than this man right here.

Critical life information,Electra23,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"The info in the Medical Medium Podcasts is so critical in this day and age, from the true causes of a variety of mystery illnesses to the shocking but previously unknown causes behind Chemtrails, and the truth behind where Fruit Fear has come from and more.  In the new shows, he has really pulled out the stops to make sure we have a clear picture of what‚Äôs really going on in this world.  Thank goodness he‚Äôs here to spread the truth!"
Not an accident,seller with a mission,09/21/2020,5 Stars,I was in Bali in February.  My husband and I attend a presentation on a product. Well the guy who suppose to do the presentation talked about Chemtrail the whole hour. Well go figure we sat there by the house on a nice day. What do you know a huge line in the sky. And a week later I get big hit while outside by a rain drop right into my left eye. What do you know it got extremely infected. I couldn‚Äôt figure it out why in the world could a rain drop have such effect on my eye. As time went on I began to put these two things together. Now I‚Äôm a mission to know about Chemtrails.
"Amazing information, the whole truth",sham-mom,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"I have healed and lived with the truth that Anthony  gifts us for 8 years. When doctors could not help he knew what was really wrong and how to heal. After working with him he has written 6 books so the amount of information that we can all have access to is phenomenal and life-changing. I have known and seen so many People Heal from this information. It helped one of my family members get off 9 medications and start living their life after being bed ridden. This information is no joke, no small miracle.  Now he is taking it up another level and I could not be more grateful.

Truth in a world full of mis information,NatalieSkye,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"Humanity is suffering from an unprecedented amount illness. Everyone knows someone that is sick or suffering with an illness that is ‚Äúin curable‚Äù. 

Anthony is a light in the darkness and he is showing people the way to true healing. He is not just another expert with an opinion. He is guided and informed by the Spirit of Compassion, sent from God, because of all of our prayers here on Earth asking for help. 

He illuminates the root cause of sickness and disease (far beyond what our medical community understands now) and gives us the tools to heal; to take back our power; and restore faith that our bodies are capable of healing themselves if only given the right environment. 

By following his protocols, I‚Äôve healed chronic cystic acne that‚Äôs plagued me for years and have healed the psoriasis on my hands when no doctor could give me answers."
Good info - hard podcast to listen to,Disappointedmore,09/21/2020,2 Stars,"I‚Äôve listened to a handful of the Medical Medium books.  I really enjoy what Anthony William has to say and have found it helpful to my health.  Unfortunately, Anthony William simply isn‚Äôt a great speaker and the podcast is hard to listen to.  The podcast is more him ranting at his doubters than actually providing useful information. He also repeats almost everything he says, almost everything he says - which is truly annoying.  If he would leave the rant out, and work on not saying everything twice, the useful information in each podcast could be boiled down to roughly 10-15.  It‚Äôs frustrating to sit through 45 minutes of ranting and repeating just to get to 10 minutes of good information.  Even though I find the information invaluable, I just can‚Äôt listen to Anthony William himself.  I‚Äôll stick to just reading his books."

MOST PROFOUND TRUTH,chasmyn,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"This is without a doubt the greatest podcast I have ever listened to. Medical Medium drops profound truth you won‚Äôt hear anywhere else, and if you think you do, it came from him first. I don‚Äôt say that lightly. I say that having done years worth of research, none of which came close to the information that Medical Medium provides. 

I was so incredibly sick with chronic illness, and dozens of doctors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, and specialists couldn‚Äôt help me. They said I was incurable. They said I would be in a wheelchair and homebound the rest of my life. They said I would continue to deteriorate for the rest of my life. 

Medical Medium information has been healing me. It brought me back from the page long list of diagnoses I had. It brought me out of the wheelchair and out of my house. It has helped me heal depression, anxiety, complex PTSD and chronic pain and fatigue. It helped me heal from mast cell activation disorder, POTS, EDS, fibromyalgia, migraines, acne, rosacea, eczema and so much more.

 This information is truth from above. It comes from an untainted source. There is no money behind it, no financial interests. It just works because it‚Äôs the truth about how our bodies work, how we got sick and how we can heal. This information has been helping millions heal worldwide and it can help you too. 

And now it‚Äôs uncensored, and Medical Medium is dropping even more truth that you won‚Äôt hear anywhere else. This is an amazing gift to the world. Anthony William works tirelessly for the chronically ill against so many obstacles, and he does it for us, so that we can heal. Do yourself a favor and try this information on. If you approach it with an open mind and heart, you won‚Äôt be sorry. This is the way forward.

Wow! Episode 001 Chemtrails,Josslyns Grandma,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"Have you ever wondered why our skies are no longer the deep blue they used to be? I‚Äôm 53 and remember when the sky was a much deeper color of blue than it is today. 100 years ago it was even more brilliant. Just look up. Look at the sky and so many times, it‚Äôs filled with chemical trails. What the planes are dumping on us is incredibly scary. But, we have the tools to heal our bodies from these chemicals. Thank you AW and Spirit of Compassion for clarifying what I had previously tried to research. ‚ú®üôèüèª‚ú®"
Saved My life!,LiveAgainHealth,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"I feel sorry for the impatient judgmental people who can‚Äôt see the light here that Anthony offers so freely and fervently every day of his life! I really do. Maybe they‚Äôre not sick enough. That‚Äôs my only conclusion, because I had been searching and eliminating foods from my diet, trying many different modalities, studying herbs and working in an herb store for 10 years. I still kept getting worse.  Anthony gives us the answers that we need, whether anybody likes it or not.  He is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. I couldn‚Äôt see straight, or think straight, incredible fatigue, anaemic, scared, isolated, depressed, anxious...trying to be normal for just a little while... if you want real health back, he is your man! If you‚Äôre not ready yet, he‚Äôll be here when you are.  It took me 31 years to find him. Im grateful to the bone! If you want real help, real Progress, real hope, real health! You‚Äôve come to the right place! He‚Äôs the real deal! Not endorsed, not paid for by big corporations. A real gift from God! Much love to you Anthony!!! Thank you to the moon and back!"
LISTENER BEWARE,elementalair,09/21/2020,1 Star,"First of all, for every bit of this podcaster‚Äôs exacting memorization of disease names and debilitating health syndromes, He. Is. No. Doctor. Something he states quite plainly at the end of each of his podcasts. And he under no circumstances should be considered as such. He is simply a non-expert who has read textbooks. That is all.  Oh and he hears voices, but that‚Äôs another matter.

One thing he has also turned out to be is a ruthless fear-mongerer, of the most loathsome variety.

After listening to a number of his podcasts I would hesitate to say he‚Äôs not on the right side of the battle for personal health empowerment, but his new season has descended swiftly into the dark and toxic waters of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and that places him squarely within the most bold and feckless tinfoil-hat Qanon rank and file. 

This should not be tolerated.

Listener beware: this guy is ascribing the leading cause of our most haunting and debilitating health issues to chemicals falling from the sky from secret government spy planes. Not even kidding. Chemtrails? Really?? Not the unhealthy lifestyles we all choose to lead and our bad diet decisions, but chemtrails. 

What makes this guy so dangerous is how he instills trust through his sympathetic, almost condescendingly so, friendly banter about an area we all hold most dear and sacred, our personal health. Do not fall victim. Do not listen to this self-important, self-indulgent ‚ÄúI heard it from the stars‚Äù garbage.  Get your green shake recipes elsewhere, people.

This podcast ultimately is quite dangerous to a part of your life you need sharp right now, your mental health. So, listener, beware."
Thank you!,JP Frisco,09/21/2020,5 Stars,"I‚Äôve heard of chem trails... now it all makes sense. Thank you for sharing the truth.  We live in such time of deception, it‚Äôs scary.  God please help us all."

Chemtrails: The Sky is Falling,Carmen Azpeitia,09/20/2020,5 Stars,"I heard someone say ‚Äúin the time of information, ignorance is a choice‚Äù but, you need to hear Anthony Williams‚Äô talks and read his books to realize how much misinformation is actually all around us regarding food, healing and the causes of chronic illness. In the podcast Chemtrails: The Sky is Falling, Anthony Williams give the listener unprecedented information regarding the real reason for the chemtrails and what to do to protect your health and those of your loved ones. This podcast is not for the faint of heart or for those who are not ready to hear the truth as to why the world‚Äôs climate change is happening and how all living organisms are being affected as well as the alarming rise of rare, undiagnosed and chronic illness. It takes courage and an inquisitive open mind to truly listen to all the priceless information that Anthony Williams so kindly provides to humanity. Do yourself a favor and put aside your preconceived ideas, judgements and skepticism aside and listen to this podcast. Love and light always!"

Your gift,donyasana,09/20/2020,3 Stars,"You have been given a gift that is so interesting and thoughtful.  You are so generous to share this wisdom with the world.  Your books have a ton of useful and intriguing information that I feel I can apply to my everyday life.  I personally am not suffering from any specific illness, but have no doubt that at age 48 something is a brewing! I am also an RN, so I find it easy to make sense of  your recommendations.  I have your Liver Detox book on audible, but I love listening to podcasts so I was thrilled that I would have the opportunity to listen and learn straight from you. 
If I were to guess you have been hurt and ridiculed a lot in your lifetime. Which makes total sense because being a medium isn‚Äôt in the norm. But unfortunately I feel like in this podcast that scrutiny resonates through your voice.  You sound so defensive and almost condescending. I feel like anyone listening to this pod cast, is listening because they are already interested in your advice.  It‚Äôs not easy to listen to you, you kind of sound... I don‚Äôt want to say narcissistic, but maybe pompous. I always skip the first 30 minutes, because the content is mostly useless and feels like you just like to hear yourself talk.  I have definitely recommended your books, but I never recommend your podcasts. I was hoping this new season would be an easier listen.  I just feel like more people would listen if you were more likable. Humble yourself, you are blessed, but not better."
Life changing information,Lisssss1234,09/20/2020,4 Stars,"THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE PODCAST BACK!!!! I‚Äôve sincerely missed the weekly podcasts and breakdown of information found in the books.

Thank you for bringing this back and providing additional information. You‚Äôre so very appreciated and loved"
The truth isn‚Äôt always easy to hear,MMmommyTrinity,09/20/2020,5 Stars,"Anthony William is a really special person to our family. His and Spirit of Compassion‚Äôs healing information and in particular the healing protocol for Autism completely transformed our son from nonverbal and not making eye contact to talking, expressing his feelings, making friends and having empathy for others. I have struggled with severe PCOS since puberty and have tried every drug, doctor and natural therapy and it wasn‚Äôt until I found Medical Medium a few years ago that I actually began to heal and now I have regular periods for the FIRST time in my life and I am 40 years old. I could go on and on about how the information in his books has helped us but you get the idea. And still this podcast has caused a stir in our family this morning. There has been lots of passionate discourse between my husband and myself. I highly recommend listening to this podcast, but it may really challenge your world view and cause some friction in your relationships. The truth isn‚Äôt always easy to hear.  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I want to know what‚Äôs really going on even if it‚Äôs unpleasant and shocking to hear. Knowledge is power. Thank you AW for this new podcast! I look forward to the next episode."

Forever Grateful for the information Anthony shares.,Grateful to be on the path,09/14/2020,5 Stars,"I have studied holistic health for over 30 years and worked in healing centers, chiropractic centers, and massage practices. I  have taught in the natural and organic food industry for many years.   I have a library of western medicine and alternative medicine books, including Chinese Medicine.  Anthony‚Äôs books rise above all of them. I am certified in plant based nutrition, reiki healing, massage healing, flower essence healing, and I carry a degree in education .   I have lived with a bone marrow disorder for over 30 years, and done exceptionally well using alternative practices and a healthy diet. I have never taken chemotherapy, which is the prescribed treatment for what I have. Thus, I have had to be a bridge walking in both western and alternative medicine.  My first oncologist called my holistic Dr a quack.  I fired him.  He lacked an open mind.  Anthony‚Äôs books have filled in the gaps of so much misunderstood in medicine.  The depth of knowledge he shares of the causes of all disease, the anatomy and physiology of the body, how to heal, and the amazing and magical power of food is absolutely amazing, and holistic in the truest sense.  The Spirit of Compassion has taught Anthony every day since he was 4 years old.  The medical paradigms we have lived in are collapsing and I for one am ok with this.  Medicine is supposed to be guided by the motto, do no harm, yet, prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death (pre-covid).  It is not easy to step outside of the current western medical paradigm which is run by pharma, insurance and investors. Drs. know there is so much wrong with medicine today, but how to change it, that is another matter.  Well God is here to help and through the Spirit of Compassion, has chosen Anthony to carry this true and sacred info to the masses.  Anthony is human and I am forever grateful for the personal sacrifices he has had to make to be the messenger.  You think any aspect of his life was normal?  Not even as a child.   To those who have ears to hear and eyes to see, this is the real deal.  A blessing for so many who have suffered.  God is fast forwarding us on how to get balanced again and providing the truth on how to heal.  It will not happen with the snap of your fingers though.  There are many special interests not wanting the business of sickness to go away.  It‚Äôs your choice.   Try Anthony‚Äôs books and you be the judge."
I would like a refund on the last 30 mins of my life,Emily Mukai,09/06/2020,1 Star,"This is one of the worst health podcasts I have ever listened to. I‚Äôve read Medical Medium and enjoyed it but this makes me reconsider what Anthony has to offer. If I wanted to listen to a narcissist randomly rant about everything that everyone else doesn‚Äôt know, and provide NO valuable information, I‚Äôd watch Fox News. He sounds like a creepy megalomaniac cult leader. This was beyond useless. Also, anyone who wants to return their fianc√© because they‚Äôve been diagnosed w Hashimotos and they were ‚Äúexpecting a healthy partner‚Äù is actually a trash human."
Does he ever offer help or only talk about himself?,BNK1025150925,09/05/2020,1 Star,Listening to the adrenal fatigue episode... I‚Äôm 25 min in and he hasn‚Äôt even talked about what it is/solutions but instead spent 25 min talking about how he‚Äôs right/others are wrong/poor us. Kind of insane and a huge turn off! Won‚Äôt be listening again.

Thank you Anthony & Spirit of Compassion."
Look elsewhere,RowboTony,08/03/2020,1 Star,"When the first full 60 seconds are disclaimers about the lack of the hosts qualifications, this is your warning to stop listening immediately. I listened to the psoriasis podcast, which only served to tell me the most basic information I can find myself in Googling ‚Äúwhat makes psoriasis worse‚Äù. The entire podcast is a plug to buy his books, talking in circles, and repeating the same thing five different ways - the podcast could have been 1/4 of the length without the rambling. Of course there isn‚Äôt one book to rule them all, you must buy all the books to really get the information you ‚Äúneed‚Äù, ugh!"

Anthony William is brilliant,Psm1626,06/01/2020,5 Stars,"I first listened to Anthony William on the Food Revolution Network, and he was talking about Epstein Barr Syndrome. Everything he was talking about was exactly what I have been experiencing since I was diagnosed. I began following his recommendations, especially starting my day with celery and cilantro juice.

Thank you!,xfitma,05/01/2020,5 Stars,"I love listening to your podcasts. I‚Äôm grateful to have found you 4 years ago on Facebook. I had just moved and was in a new state, away from family. I was going through dizziness, hot flashes, tiredness, eye sight was blurry. I started buying the supplements you recommended and started celery juice! What a huge difference. I am no longer tired, no eye problems and best of all I guess I went through menopause with no complications like other women get. Soo lucky! If I don‚Äôt have celery juice in the morning- I get tired. I realize I need it. I have family members who have health issues and I am helping them with your recommendations. There are so many haters out here and I just want to say- how can AW be fake when all he‚Äôs doing is educating everyone on what to take- all natural! He hasn‚Äôt made his own pill? He hasn‚Äôt created his own fad! Celery is from God people!! He is just telling us to drink it because of its benefits! He doesn‚Äôt have his name on any supplement bottles!

Follow yellow brick road,sumshine daydream,02/09/2020,5 Stars,"Staying healthy takes a lot of work. Between the stress and the daily grind it‚Äôs just not an easy task.
I maintained a pretty healthy diet and have exercised pretty regularly for the past 40 years. Like everything else there have been ebbs and
Flows but for the most part a healthy life style became important to me when I turned 20 and 40 years later it has drastically improved thanks to Anthony.
I was never a real big red meat eater but I did consume my fair share of poultry and of course eggs and cheese. Cheese was my love and I could return home after work and devour a hunk of cheese without much effort, I mean who couldn‚Äôt?
For the most part I felt pretty good. Decent energy level and didn‚Äôt get sick all that often.
Getting older leaves you with subtle changes to your body and the constant reminder that time marches on. 
My office mate who‚Äôs is 47 years of age and looks 35 turned me on to Anthony and my health has drastically improved.
I have been vegan now for about two years. I thought giving up eggs and cheese would be difficult however I have never looked back and notice a drastic changes in my body‚Äôs well being. I used to wake up feeling a bit stiff however that is all gone. I even have a cyst on the back of my head they has almost disappeared thanks to reduced inflammation in in my body.
I increased drastically my consumption of vegetable and fruits and I have added many of the essential supplements such as spirulina and wheat barley grass to my morning smoothie.
I can‚Äôt do it all but I do as much as I can which includes many of the grains he recommends and the herbal teas and vitamins and mineral supplements. It‚Äôs amazing what a difference it makes.
Anthony sums it up nicely by never preaching that you have to do it all but whatever you can afford to do and whatever you have the fortitude to follow through on will only reap benefits and he‚Äôs right.
Listen to pod casts and heal. To be honest most of what he says is pretty common sense and that‚Äôs the irony. I do an enormous amount of reading and slowly many of Anthony‚Äôs theories and ideas which to many seem incomprehensible and confusing is slowly being reported in medical journals, research and everyday conversation.
Conventional doctors will never admit to any of it as all of this directly affects their careers and all they have been brainwashed to say.
This doesn‚Äôt mean if you become ill and you need  to take an antibiotic you don‚Äôt, but listen to your body and so much of what ails is can be fixed by simple healthy measures.
Think green!! Good luck üòä"
Total BS,Kimmy62574,02/02/2020,1 Star,This guy is awful. I listened for 21 minutes only to discover my liver will never turn its back on me or blow me off for other friends. Not sure how that information could ever be considered medical. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an uninformed audience perfectly suited to this fear-based medical advice. Perhaps he reveals more in the next book...You think?? I‚Äôll stick with evidence-based medicine.

"Excellent podcasts, and very helpful!",Chazho,01/21/2020,5 Stars,"It seems like quite a few people quickly dismiss Anthony William, because what he says doesn‚Äôt fit their beliefs. But, consider this: Many people have chronic illnesses, and have suffered for a long time, because their doctors haven't been able to help them.

Conventional medicine doesn't know what is the cause of most chronic illnesses, so the best they can do is to treat the symptoms. The person may feel better, but their health gets worse, because the cause of the illness hasn't been eliminated. And the prescription drugs often have side effects that causes additional problems, requiring band aiding their symptoms, etc. Without knowing the cause, there is no way to heal.

Regardless of what a person thinks about the source of Anthony William's information, his advice has helped many people heal from conditions that their doctors were unable to help them with. Just take a look at the testimonials (on Instagram, for example) to see the stories. I have personally witnessed the results of taking his advice."
So informative!,beccaboos55,01/17/2020,5 Stars,This has been so cool to listen to! Would love an episode on PNH and how to live with it.
Repetition is for our benefit,shannonallysa,12/29/2019,5 Stars,"This is the truth that he is sharing with us and not many ppl know or are able to talk openly about these types of health concerns , let alone have solutions. This information is a gift from God. And I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôve ever read the Bible , then you may find a similar theme in the repetitive nature lol.. it is so the information sinks in. We need to hear things over and over for it to really be processed and retained üòáüôè‚ù§Ô∏è thanks to his messages I have a future that‚Äôs not miserable . Thank u for sharing Anthony . You are saving lives ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I really tried,EmDewMom,01/02/2020,1 Star,"I wish Spirit would help him get to the point.  I actually like this guy‚Äôs books, but I can‚Äôt waste my life listening to his verbal diarrhea. This podcast should be 10-15 minutes long max, for the 5 minutes of content it contains.  I‚Äôve never written a bad review but, come on man, listen to yourself.  Sorry:("

AMAZING!!!,Wowzzerrrzzz,12/07/2019,5 Stars,Thanks so much for all you do!
You are an angel!,Cait V.,12/03/2019,5 Stars,You‚Äôve changed my life and I am forever grateful for the soul that you are. Thank you for speaking up and thank you for doing what you do!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
Soothing voice,illite,12/02/2019,5 Stars,"Anthony‚Äôs voice has become so soothing to me. ‚ÄúSoul‚Äôs Gold‚Äù is one of the best podcasts I‚Äôve ever listened to‚Äîit has so much passion & raw human authenticity in it. I replay it when I feel down about struggling in life & being chronically ill. 

After listening to almost all of his podcasts, I now understand the level of compassion & commitment Anthony has to helping people feel better. Go ahead & get lost in the contradictory theories of science & research if you want to. While you do that, I will be following Medical Medium advice because it is literally working & helping me heal!!!"
Feel better !,Mamaconcerned,10/18/2019,5 Stars,"I definitely feel more energy, More calm,
& Sleep better following the MM recommendations of celery juice & cucumber juice, more fruit and the vitamin protocol."
Very repetitive it‚Äôs annoying to listen to,tmicpa,11/05/2019,1 Star,"He repeats his words 3, 4 or 5 times, it makes for a very difficult listen. He also rambles, these podcasts could be 15 to 20 minutes at most, but the repetition and rambling is a waste of your time. I found his book, to repetitive too, however, was easier to listen to than these podcasts."
What a joke,Bunbury1211,11/02/2019,1 Star,"Just terrible. His compulsion like repetition and his unbelievable ignorance makes this a complete joke. He spends a majority of his time desperately trying to convince you he is right and the rest of his time rambling about but never saying anything empirically based or constructive. If you want the educated community to take you seriously, focus on evidence from peer reviewed, empirical studies to back your claims. If there are none and you believe you are right, you publish some."
Want to give five,jenpay109,10/30/2019,4 Stars,Love his energy and message but struggling to get passed all the repetition his words.
I can‚Äôt get enough of Medical Medium!,Natalies Schlute,10/16/2019,5 Stars,"Anthony William‚Äôs work is absolutely amazing. I‚Äôm so grateful that he has chosen to share his gift and knowledge with the world. I honestly don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be without him. I‚Äôve suffered from health issues for almost 30 years (I‚Äôm 34), and the worst of it was in the last 15 years. I was listening to mainstream media for medical advice and doctors couldn‚Äôt help me. By following his recommendations, reading the books, and filling myself with inspiration from this podcast, I‚Äôm finally on the road to healing. He truly is God sent. I recommend this podcast to everyone I know!"

Binge Listen Now!!,JasonRash,09/16/2019,5 Stars,If you have any sort of chronic illness drop what you are doing and BINGE on this podcast!!
Annoying podcast,maryinwellesley,09/28/2019,3 Stars,"I think he likes to hear himself talk. He could provide all the info he needs in 5-10 minutes This guy provides no scientific research...   Functional medicine is based on science 
Could be good, but too much chatter which makes him sound uneducated"
Eating disorders,Lalaawesoem,09/25/2019,1 Star,"I am giving this 0 star!
It completely gave me headache listening to it. All i kept hearing throughout the half hour of it that i had to turn of it was ‚Äúeating disorder‚Äù which was said probably hundred times or more.  There was never at one point that be even started to talked what those were . All he kept saying and saying was how theyre so many of them. Not only that the voice as well was annoying and could not deliberate the info well, this was a total waste of time and completely presented by someone with lack of knowledge and facts and info"
Podcast on fast forward,Margaritas5,09/16/2019,1 Star,The information in his books is very enlightening. I figured I could listen to his podcast to get a little more insight. Trying to listen to him talk was so painful. He was talking as if someone sped up his voice to fit more into the podcast. It was like listening to a child try and tell a story.
Finally,scomp35,09/09/2019,5 Stars,"I feel as though I have finally found honest, true information.  If you are or know anyone who has been sick with no help here is your answers.  Thank you Anthony for giving all your information from spirit."
Awesome,j_j1234*,09/06/2019,5 Stars,"This guy is out there in the best possible way, and I absolutely love him for it! Excellent, sensible advice delivered with so much energy and spirit. Anthony is such a refreshing voice in the health field, and he gets me excited about making health changes. I‚Äôm not sure I agree with his advice about spirulina and iodine for hashimotos. All other recommendations seem legit though."
Autoimmune,nicknameistoomuchwork,08/21/2019,5 Stars,"I‚Äôm 54 & 3 years ago I was told I had RA & a host of autoimmune diseases. I went to numerous Dr‚Äôs & was still had debilitating pain... joint pain, which made it hard to walk/function. I was sleeping 16+ hrs a day & loosing hope. Then, a friend suggested I talk to one of Anthony William‚Äôs practitioners. Gretchen immediately told me what I had & that I would get better. She said be patient & change your diet & take a few supplements. I was skeptical, but desperate. So, I changed to a mostly fruit & veggie diet with celery juice every am. Much to my surprise & delight... I slowly got better. Today, I feel better than I have in my entire life. I working out 5 days a week, have no allergies, no headaches, no joint pain & no stomach issues. Thank you Anthony & Gretchen for changing my life!"
Where‚Äôs the evidence?,Lara907,08/22/2019,1 Star,"I listened to the lupus episode. As a person that started my health journey with alternative medicine, I‚Äôve been through all the roads that avoided immunosuppressants, using holistic approaches, including heavy metal detox, changing diets, etc etc. I have dealt with all underlying causes like Co-occurring infections. 
Sorry, Lupus is still on board. 
Frankly, no one knows what causes Lupus, though there is newer evidence and medication that is targeting the B cells in the immune system. So, yes, there is an immune system component to Lupus (look into Benlysta for more info). 
Western medicine is now the only thing keeping me on my feet. 
As to the podcast, it took 15 min of ranting before Lupus was even mentioned (and no, not all patients with Lupus are diagnosed with Lyme.) 20 min into it, he still wasn‚Äôt addressing Lupus. Do you know how difficult it actually is to get diagnosed with Luke outside the east coast? Extremely. 
Frankly, I‚Äôve always suspected that Anthony is a fraud. With no medical background (why not go to medical school so you at least have some working knowledge of what you‚Äôre clients are dealing with?), he charges ridiculous amounts to tell people to address Epstein Barr virus and juice celery to detox? 
Folks, 95% of the population has EBV by five years old. It‚Äôs a good bet that any given person has it. It‚Äôs also a good bet that most people are nutritionally deficient if they haven‚Äôt already changed their diet to whole foods with some supplements. Do a google search and all this information is available to read online."
Anthony and Spirit are the Best!,sapmurr,08/19/2019,5 Stars,"When you‚Äôre sick with chronic illness and after a multitude of tests, hospital and doctor visits, and the medical community has no idea how to help you, the Medical Medium has helped me heal. Thank you Anthony and Spirit! Looking forward to feeling better than I did before my autoimmune diagnosis."
Thank you Anthony!!,julsintexas,08/12/2019,5 Stars,"I listen to the celery juice podcast and then the celery juice and teeth and gums podcast, I have learned so much in one day -I am so excited. So thankful for Anthony‚Äôs knowledge, real knowledge and hope this will help so many open their eyes! I Just got the liver rescue book in and I cannot wait to see what all of this knowledge does for me and my friends and family.

GET TO THE POINT,wendy red mac,08/16/2019,1 Star,"Bought all the books. Extremely informative. Expected to get highlights, tips, and quick info on book subjects in a condensed way. The amount of non stop chatter, talking in circles, and spending 30minutes of the podcast never getting to the point was disappointing. I will stick to the books and continue to appreciate his wisdom that way."
Most Helpful Info I Have Ever Heard,Yaya2928,07/31/2019,5 Stars,"For the past three years, my doctors and I could not figure out why I was waking up in the middle of the night choking on thick mucus. It was so scary I did not even want to fall asleep. My allergy doctor at first said I had acid reflux. When meds for that did not help, he said it must be that I don‚Äôt have enough stomach acid and gave prescriptions for that. I did a sleep study that gave no clues. Also visited chiropractors and alternative medicine providers. Only when I started incorporating Anthony‚Äôs eating advice and also added celery juice to my mornings did I find relief. Priceless information that modern medicine does not know about. Thank you, Anthony, for sharing this incredible gift of yours!"
Get to the point,Leeny813,08/04/2019,1 Star,"This guys spends a solid 20 minutes talking in circles and shoveling out his own self-proclaimed credentials without actually sharing any information. Be informative, not talkative."
PCOS,jkhjhfytrutkij,06/29/2019,5 Stars,Thank you so much for putting your information out about PCOS.  I have suffered for 10 years with it and your podcast about it blew me away to tears of gratitude.
This guy hears voices! That‚Äôs his medical qualification.,LazFuentes,07/30/2019,1 Star,"This guy is not a doctor or a nutritionist or at all qualified. 

HE SAYS THAT HE HEARS A VOICE HE CALLS ‚ÄúSPIRIT‚Äù THAT GIVES HIM MEDICAL INFORMATION."
Poor speaking skills,bayareakorean,07/29/2019,1 Star,"Get to the point. I really gave him a chance and listened to 6 pods to give him the benefit of the doubt, but listening to him speak is excruciating.  Not so much his knowledge of the matter, but the way he repeats and emphasizes is about half the pod and the other half is somewhat interesting. Just spit the points out and less babble. Unsubscribed."
Disappointed.,dreamydria,07/24/2019,1 Star,I‚Äôm a strong believer in holistic medicine and was looking forward to hearing Anthony‚Äôs podcast because I recently bought one of his books. I listened to the episode on celery juice and eczema and it was cringe worthy. Seemed like he was defending himself and trying to prove himself throughout the whole podcast. More promotional than educational. Weird vibes.
What did he just say??,Powder Puff 7,07/15/2019,1 Star,"Never has someone used so many words and said so little! He speaks in circles, repeats the same ‚Äúselling points‚Äù over and over while you are waiting for some actual information about the show subject. Honestly exhausted after listening to him talk."
Wow,lupa4452,07/12/2019,1 Star,A master class in talking a lot without saying anything.
"Repeat, repeat and repeat again",Ladyb2343,07/10/2019,2 Stars,I have a hard time listening because all Anthony does is keep repeating what he says.
Anthony William Saved My Life!,Chanelle_betty,06/27/2019,5 Stars,"Anthony William is the real deal! His information is 100% pure, straight from Spirit, and his information can heal and transform you if you let it! My life has been saved because of him, and because of Divine intervention in finding him! So so grateful for Anthony!"
You need to have had chronic illness to understand,nativlk,06/13/2019,5 Stars,"I feel like a lot of people won‚Äôt like this podcast or understand unless they have dealt with the illnesses and experiences Anthony talks of. I‚Äôve been chronically sick for 2 years with absolutely no answers from doctors and no help from them either. Listening to Anthony‚Äôs podcasts and beginning to read his books have made me feel like I have someone who completely understands what I‚Äôm going through. I like that he talks a lot of how women are not taken seriously in the healthcare system, especially young women like myself. I‚Äôm so thankful for Anthony for coming into my life because I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to begin a healing journey without him."
Quackery,realallergist,06/17/2019,1 Star,There is no evidence for any of this. You are fraudulent.
Thank you is not enough AW,tb4749,06/17/2019,4 Stars,"I want you to know how much I appreciate you.   Unfortunately, I have had chronic symptoms of  EBV and streptococcus.  Always blaming candida, nerve problems  ( 2 hand surgery ), yes I was told this was in my head.  Was told my full body rash was stress....Not to mention my late husband getting diagnosed with cancer throughout his entire body.   He lost his life after a tough 18 month fight....by this time I was rock bottom...I then started to read your books, all of them, soon after he passed.  Everything you share with us makes complete sense.  I understand my body is not attacking itself.....I believe now.  
I try so hard to give back and share your words, I understand some of your frustration you so often express to us through the podcast.  Most people won‚Äôt consider diet changes that need to be made to heal, some just want a pill, often most don‚Äôt want to know.  I believe fear is somehow part of their viral load.  Drs so loving, they just don‚Äôt know yet people keep doing what they say without any results.  So many sick people....sad.  

For those people out there reading this, I am real....I was very sick and  following instructions from MD/PHD for 10 years,  slowly getting worse.   I looked at myself and said, let‚Äôs do this and follow AW.  I had nothing to lose.  I stopped eggs, dairy ( all the basic others ) and added zinc and vit C.....along with the most important- fruits and more fruits, and loads of veggies.  1 year later, even suffering the loss of my dear husband of 36 years.....I am better, so much better.  If you cheat or expect healing of your body quickly , you won‚Äôt heal.  Please don‚Äôt blame spirit or AW.  You can do better, time and knowledge are key.  Have patience don‚Äôt  give up, never even 1 egg or cheese/butter...keep fats of all kind low, and barely grass powder etc.....read ingredients, just stay safe with Whole Foods. ....juice juice.   I promise you can heal, remember you body loves you and wants to heal.  Once you turn the corner, only you will know...it‚Äôs so amazing.   I am 60 and I am able to jog 5miles with absolutely no body pain!   I can cycle my road bike once again and keep up with a fast clip group.   Thank you, thank you.  This is real, it takes believing, work and dedication.   You can do this....hang in there as AW guides us to constantly turn a new corner.    
One more thing-as you dive in and start to heal, obvious symptoms will start to diminish.....once in awhile your body will reward you with healing symptoms you once knew were not normal, you just got used to them.    It‚Äôs so amazing.....again, thank you.  So Much appreciation üå∫"
Answers and Healing,Sunshinepct,06/11/2019,5 Stars,"A.W. and the medical medium book series has done nothing short of given me my life back. A short review is no place for memoirs but I had tried everything, and I mean everything. If you‚Äôre uncomfortable like I was with his source of information, that‚Äôs ok. Give it a shot without judgement, you‚Äôre ability to live is worth it :) You have my support if you‚Äôre in a place where you have nothing to lose."
Us against them,in your class,06/13/2019,1 Star,"Why do you sound like your fighting against everyone out there? You sound like you have a good message, but it‚Äôs lost with the negative perspective about what other people think. You generalize people in a negative way and as someone that is in holistic health, I stay away from a pessimistic mindset. You sound condescending ..."
Advice,gratitudeAttitudehere,06/11/2019,5 Stars,Either take the advice or move on. It‚Äôs too bad that some people are so quick to judge without trying any of it. It all makes sense to me intuitively & experientially. Take the advice or move on.
So grateful for finding this radio show,@leetotheann,06/11/2019,5 Stars,"As a nurse with a sense of ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt right‚Äù, I feel I have finally found someone that tells nothing but the truth. I‚Äôve learned more than I did in Nursing school about how the body functions in a month listening to Anthony and reading his books, than in 5 years of schooling. I am truly grateful, not only to heal myself but to have the knowledge to help guide others in their healing."
Ignore the naysayers,DJFuscia,06/03/2019,5 Stars,"I found the Medical Medium‚Äôs podcasts after reading Liver Rescue, by Anthony William (Medical Medium).  I read a couple reviews of the podcasts about Anthony repeating himself and not getting to the point. I admit I put off listening to them because of these reviews until I one about UTIs! I HAD to listen so I can get off antibiotics and never have a UTI again. Those reviews were too harsh! In many of his podcasts he first empathizes with listeners and explains why/how they have certain conditions and explains how following his information will help and how it works! The information he gives is worth the listen! Besides, if his delivery is too slow or repetitive, that‚Äôs what the buttons in your podcast player that allow you to listen at 1.5 times the speed are for.  Or using the slider to jump ahead. I found Medical Medium when I searched a local library for books about gout because my loved one has it, and I found Liver Rescue, which discusses gout. After devouring the book in days I bought it. The Liver Rescue smoothie has reduced the number of gout attacks to nearly zero, in combination with Medical Medium‚Äôs advice about what to eat and what not to.   Then I went to the book Life-Changing Foods and bought that for more food ideas (recipes). I did not think I needed the podcasts. But the podcasts emphasize certain topics and reinforce information into my brain. They are worth listening to no matter what the supposed drawbacks are to Anthony‚Äôs delivery. Worth every second. Thank you, Anthony. Ps‚ÄîI plan to relieve my other loved one‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs with Anthony‚Äôs information. Thank you, Spirit!"
Complete waste of time,Cardio girl 82,06/07/2019,1 Star,This man is a complete idiot. Don‚Äôt waste your time listening nor following his recommendations. Listen to the Dietitians not this moron.
Wonderful,HTS22,05/25/2019,5 Stars,Amazing podcast with so much helpful information. Thank you Anthony William and spirit!
Waste of time repeating BASIC stuff,EditeEditeEdite,05/26/2019,1 Star,"This guy is a waste of my time. First he goes for at least 10 minutes of self promo, and then goes completely off track from the subject of the podcasts. He should name all his episodes ‚ÄúThyroid Health‚Äù. It looks like that‚Äôs all he knows or cares about. And he repeats over and over and over ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. What a waste of my walk this morning."
Results speak for themselves!,its your body!,05/12/2019,5 Stars,"Once my own family saw my improvements they Too started juicing celery and eating lots more fruit and veggies!  Changing food habits is hard to do.   Most people don‚Äôt want to change and will use every excuse they can think of.  Look at the negative reviews!!!  It is amazing what celery juice has done for me. My skin is what I noticed first, it‚Äôs much more clear and softer and I have more energy and look younger. My ex in-laws think I am getting Botox injections. LOL. Oh!   My gallbladder is healthier and I no longer have thyroid issues.  All the pain I had is gone!!!   There is a reason this information is coming through to us. We need it at this time. Too many people are being harmed by food that is full of chemicals, pesticides and genetically modified foods.  If you want to keep eating that stuff go ahead it‚Äôs a free country.   By the same token, you can get healthy by not eating The chemical laden foods.  The naysayers should be complaining to the FDA for allowing all this horrible stuff to be in our food supply."
laughing....really?,zedstoli,05/23/2019,1 Star,so I am not sure what is so f'ing funny about restless legs. stop fricking laughing dude. you sound like a real jerk for someone who is supposed to be so empathic
"Snarky, obnoxious & arrogant!",Kikistapes,05/22/2019,2 Stars,"How can a medium deliver Spirit‚Äôs message with such an inflated ego? It makes me seriously question his legitimacy despite wanting to take in the message. He could say everything in each podcast in 1/3 the time if he wasn‚Äôt so enjoying listening to himself talk.

Please get on point and stop trying to convince us that you are THE authority and everyone else is out to get us. Most of this info Ive learned elsewhere also as a researcher so let‚Äôs get down to Earth a little please. That said thank you for your enthusiasm! I do appreciate the wake up call re buying into radical diets."
Stay on point and speak with a kinder voice.,phx313,05/20/2019,2 Stars,"I keep an open mind and believe in a healthy combination of science and holistic healing. I am also Open-minded to the concept of getting ‚Äúhelp‚Äú from spirit. I read a significant amount of material about various approaches to nutrition and overall well-being. Because there are so many messages out there, It is even more critical to retain your audience‚Äôs attention. I agree with the long list of reviewers asking Anthony to get to the point and stop rambling. The first podcast I listened to was the rumors and myths about celery juice podcast. I was taken back by how snarky his comments were and the general labeling he threw out there, which is exactly what he was arguing against. I find it shocking that somebody supposedly so connected with spirit would be referring to people as trolls. He comes across as arrogant and cocky. As a professional communicator, I can tell you you will only push people away with this approach. When I work with people who are truly connected with spirit there is a loving, humble calmness about them. They have no reason to attack others or make sarcastic comments about people. I highly recommend you stay on point and prepare better for your podcast so that you provide more information in less time. Nobody should talk about celery for 60 minutes. You can get to the point in half the time or less and people will appreciate it. Please take a step back take a breath and think about how your messages coming across particularly if you are truly representing spirit.I take spirit as being a God source, and the only thing that comes from God is love. Speak with love, we need more of that. That will help you to attract and retain a larger audience and help more people."
Best podcast you‚Äôve ever done!,$550Kseller,05/08/2019,5 Stars,"Thanks so much Anthony! My husband and I are big fans and we have been following you for almost two years. I need your podcasts and books to stay inspired to keep trying to get more celery juice and fruit into my body.  

This was absolutely hands down your best podcast.  So clearly explained the celery juice process! Thank you so much.  I‚Äôm off to the store for more celery and wild blueberries! Take care!"
"Ego and ghosts, with a side of bad medicine","Witch, but NOT a fan",05/09/2019,1 Star,"I was excited to find a new medical podcast so listened with eagerness to Medical Medium; however, I didn‚Äôt realize he meant ‚Äúmedium‚Äù in terms of ghosts. Before the kooky and awful ghost stuff, this podcast lost me. He talked for 20 minutes about himself before going into some victimization and self-grandeur fed material. ‚ÄúMedical system fails and knows nothing while me and my ghost have magically discovered the secret knowledge.‚Äù Most of what he says, doctors actually know. But, he misrepresents real knowledge and repackages it.  His good points about the dangerous influence of money, lobbyists, and pharmaceuticals are lost in a haze of rants and strange advice. I also can‚Äôt take the flip flops in how evidence-based the podcast is. 

Not for me or anyone with any science background or evidenced based approach. Also not for anyone who doesn‚Äôt take medical advice from ghosts."

Episodes are not substantive enough,jb8666,05/07/2019,3 Stars,He‚Äôs extremely knowledgeable and I trust the information he gives - but he takes forever to get to the point. Talks in circles. And the episodes have very little substance. I can find the information much faster in his blogs.
Rambling,bugass,04/23/2019,3 Stars,"I give this podcast 3 stars because the information he is trying to convey is extremely important. However, I recommend just reading his books as I have because he rambles so much in the podcast I can barely listen to it. And repeats himself constantly. Not my style."
cELerY jUiCe,Franniecccc,04/26/2019,2 Stars,oh my god get to the point. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve heard the words ‚Äúcelery juice‚Äù so many times without actually learning about celery juice. ps u didn‚Äôt invent celery you‚Äôre not the source.

This podcast rambles on and on without a main point in sight nor ‚Äúevidence‚Äù to support his claims. Eat less fatty meat and eat more vegetables and fruits. Yes. You don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúmedical medium‚Äù to tell you that."

Healing journey,theperdigons,04/11/2019,5 Stars,"I would like to praise the Medical Medium podcast because it has brought an understanding to me that resonates within every fiber of my being. When I hear Anthony William talking is like I am learning directly from a trustworthy source. More objectively, I am getting results already after almost a month following his information. Not all my issues have been resolved but I have to concede that the state of mild depression that I was carrying with me all the time is clearing up. I am feeling more clear in my thoughts and sadness is dissolving. So lots of love and a huge thank you to Spirit and Anthony, please keep helping us."
Can‚Äôt thank you enough!,clbec,04/04/2019,5 Stars,Thank you Anthony for all of your information that you so selflessly give to us. You have helped me and my family so very much!! I have been to so many doctors for so many issues and have gotten nowhere! I discovered you about 3 months ago and I can‚Äôt say how much I have begun to heal!! After all I have tried this is so simple and it actually works!!! You can repeat yourself all you want and I will listen! I learn something new every podcast and am loving it. I have gotten my parents dedicated to listening to you as well and we have all your books. You have changed our lives so much and we are so very grateful!!

Love the Repetition!,Sunwoman9,03/13/2019,5 Stars,"I know everyone is different. I actually love the way you repeat yourself because I know it is about the passion you have with the information you have received.  

I have received much of the same information over the last 30 years and I recognize it. When you repeat it ... it‚Äôs going into my brain and reprogramming it. And, the only way to really change the brain is mental repetition‚Ä¶ To change those neural pathways !  

I also love your sense of humor about it all .... The people in my family who are doing what you are talking about, including me ....are healing their bodies and creating new healthy bodies.  We are reversing the aging process and detoxing on a daily basis. I tried teaching some of the stuff myself 30 years ago and everyone thought I was crazy then. Ha ha.  I had studied with Dr. Gabriel Cousins and learned so much... 

People have a lot of walls and fear to break down to open to this amazing information and I know that those who are ready will hear you ...Thank you for taking the risk to be different and speak your truth in your own special way!"
Thank you! Please keep sharing!,Jurewhite,03/08/2019,5 Stars,You are great Anthony! I appreciate all your words and your willingness to share what ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù teaches you!!!!
Constructive criticism,ganeovfy,03/12/2019,2 Stars,"I think he has a lot of great info to share, but goodness I can‚Äôt sit through his podcasts. He rambles on and on and on about the same thing over and over and over giving very little content. His 60-minute podcast could be reduced to 30 if he only focused on building a better talk. Stick to the point. 5 minute intro for those who have never listened and then get on with it. His info is a little generic and common sense, but if it creates healthy change with the masses then so be it."
Can‚Äôt stand listening to him,shaynemw,03/11/2019,2 Stars,I‚Äôm partway through one of his books and it contains the same info without having to listen to his whiny voice and him saying the same thing over and over (although the book could be shorter if he didn‚Äôt repeat so much information there too). Get to the point!
Great podcast,C-lova,02/22/2019,5 Stars,"Thank you! 
Can you have a podcast on detoxing from vaccines?"
"Podcast is pointless, repetitive nonsense",LisaG2424,03/02/2019,1 Star,"I‚Äôve listened to two episodes so far and each time I keep waiting for him to impart useful information or make a point. It never happens. This is literally an hour of him talking with a loosely defined topic. The episode on chemical sensitivities, for example, is just about how people who have them are misunderstood. There‚Äôs no substance to what he is saying. I‚Äôm not saying the ideas he discusses in his books are wrong, but the podcast is just utter, incomprehensible nonsense. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
Hard to listen to...,Hughyuopo,03/02/2019,3 Stars,Agree with previous comment - repeats himself WAY too much. I‚Äôm having a hard time listening to a poor speaker. I‚Äôll continue to follow but can‚Äôt stand to listen any longer.
MedicAl medium,organic gypsy mama,02/26/2019,3 Stars,Good info.... but a lot of repetition. Makes it hard to listen.
Thank You,wilsonsl,02/19/2019,5 Stars,"Thank God for you Anthony! Please keep persisting in sending out the true in whatever forms you can. I love and appreciate you! I found you at just the right time in my life and am so blessed to now be able to help myself, family and friends with the truth. Bless you, thank you for persisting."
Anti aging,v.v-k.k,02/22/2019,1 Star,"This is my first time listening to you. I will be very honest. You‚Äôre killing me!!!! 30 min talking about nothing!!!!! How you cuddle with a lemon tea and talk to the spirits!!! How is it connected to the liver???? Just get to the point if you really want to help people!!!! Stop saying the same sentence over and over and over again!!!! Please read the reviews and improve your talk show. For now you‚Äôre not helping anyone, just killing everybody softly."
DO NOT LISTEN!,hanban6,02/22/2019,1 Star,"Influence does not equal expertise. He is not a medical doctor and has no medical background, no nutrition background, no science background whatsoever. He should not be diagnosing people and giving health or medical advice. Go see or listen to an actual practitioner instead!"
Get to the point!!,Toddler heaven,02/20/2019,3 Stars,"I have read his book Medical Medium and it had a lot of great info so I decided to try his podcasts... It's simply infuriating to try and get any actually helpful information out of these episodes. The repetition and the pulling in of completely unrelated stuff is really frustrating. My mystery illness is still a mystery but I recently got a clue that endometriosis may be a part of it so decided to listen to what he had to say on it... He spent waaaaayyyy longer going over all of the supposedly 'wrong' theory's science is kicking around than he did on what is ACTUALLY going on and what he recommends for treatment. Anthony, I thank you for your insights and knowledge but if you really want to help people please just get to the point and be really clear about what you recommend doing to heal, help and solve. When you go on tyraids about this treatment or that theory it makes the intake of helpful  information really challenging and it makes finding the time to take in the info even harder. The endometriosis episode could have been 10 minutes long and given all the helpful wisdom you wanted to share about this disease."
Thank God for the Medical Medium!!!,JTiger98,02/18/2019,5 Stars,"The Medical Medium information saved my life.  It's pure, clean, untampered with truth from a higher source.  Don't be fooled by all the profit-driven trends out there.  Learn the truth so you can heal as I have and as so many others are doing."
Repeating yourself!!,m rudolf123,02/18/2019,2 Stars,Stop repeating yourself!!  Please!  I really wanted to listen to this but Wow. Just say something one time and move on.
Too much whining,Lalapalooza22222,02/16/2019,3 Stars,I have great respect for his knowledge and want to learn more but he spending the whole time whining about everybody else‚Äôs misinformation
I repeat,lnoodles,02/12/2019,5 Stars,Stop hitting the repeat button. Lol
Good info but poor delivery,annamission512,02/14/2019,3 Stars,This podcast is difficult to listen to only due to the repetitious nature of Anthony‚Äôs delivery. I appreciate the information and will continue to listen but please use more filtering and editing so it‚Äôs not so laborious!
28 day cleanse,alsjsjdhfufuturjfbfbnxjssj,02/14/2019,1 Star,Jeez! This is just a sales pitch. You are repeating everything over and over again. I had to stop listening at minute 24
Fraud,12bucklemysh0e,02/13/2019,1 Star,"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but this guy has got to be the most arrogant, ignorant, and outrageous fraud I‚Äôve heard since Trump. He says nothing, but claims to know everything."
Repeating,Dsmith012002,02/13/2019,1 Star,"There is a lot of repetitiveness in the podcast. It will be reduced in time and increased effectiveness if this is addressed.
Thank you."
Anthony William is the single voice of reason,Ree Vewer,02/12/2019,5 Stars,"In a world gone mad with money and special interests. Ignore the paid reviews by trolls, this information will save your life if you need it and you follow the instructions in his books. His generosity and transparency in the ‚Äòcool‚Äô social media stupid platforms belies his intent: he‚Äôs here to give a voice to MILLIONS of people who are being destroyed by wrong information. Mute the nonsense out there and just try one of his remedies (celery juice daily on an empty stomach) and see for yourself. I love you, Anthony, and appreciate all you do."
Very informative and Truthful,mynnes,02/07/2019,5 Stars,What I like about this podcast is learning the truth about nutrition. I like Anthony cuz he is not backed up or sponsored by science and research ..not selling any products..he just speaks the truth and you just need to eat the right kind of food. I have listened to other nutrition podcast but I like this one the best. I have changed my diet completely for good..thanks to the medical medium podcast. I always listen every time I drive to and from work.. Very helpful!!!
Just read the book.,Sandiew,02/11/2019,1 Star,I love the info but I‚Äôll just read your book. I can‚Äôt listen to the same sentence over and over... üòí
Repetition solved,Juliana Jordani,02/02/2019,5 Stars,"For those who can‚Äôt stand to the repetition, please buy his books - there‚Äôs no repetition at all."

You‚Äôre awesome.,Jennifer A F,02/02/2019,5 Stars,"Thank you so much for sharing your information. 
I need help with my adult asthma & allergies. I cannot get enough of your information. I keep reading and searching and listening to all your podcasts. I am determined I can reverse and heal myself and my kids without medications.

...One thing please, quit saying ‚ÄúO my God‚Äù 
God bless you"
Unbelievable!,susan4now,02/01/2019,5 Stars,"This is a word used a lot by this man in all of the podcasts I have listened to. I agree with most of the reviews: there maybe some good content in his hour long talks, but the repetition of words and phrases ruins it for me. The constant use of the word ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù makes me wonder if this is his subconscious speaking the real truth. I‚Äôm unsubscribing."
Gratitude for this,kittychi,01/30/2019,5 Stars,"So happy and lucky to have discovered this podcast and the incredible books.  The information is literally life changing...healing, not treating.  Huge difference.  Thank you Anthony William."
Slow down please,Snowchicksmc,01/31/2019,4 Stars,I am getting anxiety from listening. Love the information but can you please sllllooooowww down.
"Listened to two, that was enough for me.",spinmeaneatclean,01/31/2019,1 Star,Takes ENTIRELY too long to get to the point of the podcast. I listened to one podcast and was highly annoyed but I decided to give another a shot. The podcast on anti-aging could be summed up in about 10 minutes. WAY too much rambling on and on and on. I just can‚Äôt listen anymore. Most people are busy and don‚Äôt have time for useless talk. I mean he doesn‚Äôt just give one or two examples of what he‚Äôs explaining but it‚Äôs like 15-20 and after two examples WE GET IT!!!!!
Thank you,Primal & Aluve,01/25/2019,5 Stars,Thank you for your gift . You changed my life .
Anxiety levels through the roof,lifelong student of health,01/29/2019,1 Star,"I wanted to learn from this podcast but he is so negative and his tone of voice stressed me out so much that I had to turn it off. He repeats himself over and over and it just makes you so anxious. And also, the lip smacking... I can‚Äôt."
For the love of god please ease up on the reputation.,Podcastlover3244,01/26/2019,1 Star,Please read all the reviews that talk about you repeating yourself too much. People listen because they want detailed information not sales a pitch or constant repetition.
I have a question,parashka,01/26/2019,4 Stars,Can you tell me more about cysts and if they can be cured?
Repeat. And say nothing,JCope62,01/25/2019,2 Stars,"I tried. I really did. I tried two different podcasts and you just repeat yourself over and over and over. And, very little substance. I‚Äôm glad lots of people seem to be helped by what you say but there‚Äôs no way I can invest the time in this podcast."
"Be Patient when listening, Anthony cares about our health",2/8,01/24/2019,5 Stars,"After 3.5 years of dealing with a Grave‚Äôs diagnosis (and pushing through a year of auto immune paleo) finding Anthony is FINALLY giving me a sense of understanding, relief and best of all, hope.

I trust his guidance from Spirit, and his passion is inspiring. Thank you AW and Spirit for bringing this knowledge to us now! üíïüêãüíï"
Amazing Content!,KendraBran,01/21/2019,5 Stars,"Anthony, thank you from the bottom of my heart for being an open channel and sharing all the Spirit shares with you. It is life changing for me and my family. All that you say rings true. It all makes sense. THANK YOU. I continue to pray for you!üôèüèº"
"Thank you, thank you for saving my life!",Amy Kate Smith,01/14/2019,5 Stars,Thank you for the wealth of information you share. I don‚Äôt know what I would have done without this information.
Repetition,gemininurse123,01/20/2019,3 Stars,"I love listening and will try to continue to do so but there is so much repetition in the words and sentences. Is it to make the podcast longer? Is it to beat it into our heads? He will repeat half a sentence, laugh, and go on to another sentence. I feel like I‚Äôm watching a dog chase its tail or a toddler tell a story while playing with toys and running around the living room."
"Good info, not organized",Burr burr burr,01/19/2019,2 Stars,"I have read two of his books, so I was excited to see the podcast. This is in need of an organized set up. Repetition can be a good tool, but it is highly overused in this format. 

Your podcast is in need of a succinct introduction and conclusion, as well as an organized body.  The amount of repetition makes me want to fast forward to find what your point is."
Celery Juice,nicka83,01/18/2019,1 Star,Where is the substance? It sounds like a long infomercial for his books. I‚Äôve tried 2 podcasts and can‚Äôt listen to anymore. So repetitive. It‚Äôs like one L O N G introduction and the podcast never gets off the ground. So disappointing.
I agree,Colgirl,01/11/2019,5 Stars,Love the info. Could get through it faster with out the constant repeating.  But love the info. Thank You for your wisdom.
Good Info but...,Celaree,01/11/2019,3 Stars,I feel maybe explaining a little bit more on researches to back them up and how things work instead of doing a lot of repeating (babbling-sorry to say) would bring my rating for him to a higher one.
Weight gain podcast,Dg111576,01/11/2019,1 Star,"Hello.  I‚Äôve been doing my celery juice and was excited to listen to my first podcast. But unfortunately I had to turn it off. With all due respect, it came off more like an angry rant than an educational opportunity. Maybe you can consider a less conversational format and more of an educational format so that the information you have, which seems so important, can be dispersed?  Not trying to be critical, just constructive."
Literally life changing,Bree Voelbel,01/08/2019,5 Stars,"Keep doing what your doing, because it‚Äôs flawless!!

Woah settle down,Luviepip,01/10/2019,2 Stars,"Ok super annoying to listen too. I feel like there is a lot of rambling. It‚Äôs hard to sift through all the yada yada to get to the few gems he offers. And I don‚Äôt feel like he spends enough time explaining the why behind things. He‚Äôs too busy repeating himself and trying to sound way too excited and energetic about how nobody else in the universe has discovered the things he has. I‚Äôm sure celery juice is good and helped a lot of people, but I believe this podcast format of him ranting hurts his cause more than helps it."
Truth is life changing,Nxman,12/23/2018,5 Stars,Anthony‚Äôs compassion for others is so apparent in his podcasts. The information he gives is literally life changing. Even if you think you‚Äôre ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù you should take a listen because chances are you‚Äôre not and he can help without you having to buy into a scam. I found him about a month ago and I cant stop listening. Have two years worth of catching up to do and I‚Äôm about half way!! Thank you thank you thank you Anthony. üôåüèº
Just so you know,jkbrtc,01/08/2019,3 Stars,Your book is $35 not $15.
jmjh4234567,jmjh423456789,01/06/2019,1 Star,sorry but you are so arrogant and quit repeating yourself!  so annoying.
Please stop repeating yourself,LegoSam112233,01/04/2019,2 Stars,"I‚Äôm literally repeating another reviewer in the hopes it will make an impact! Pleeeeaase stop repeating yourself! We heard it the first time. We are smart people with listening ears. We want to learn from you. I even bought your book! But the constant repetition takes away from your validity as an expert and my confidence in you is waning. My suggestion: make an outline for your podcast, highlighting the points you want to make. Don‚Äôt stray. Don‚Äôt repeat. Please, please, please."
One problem,ShioN915,01/03/2019,2 Stars,"Great context, I like the way you deliver the message but the way you constantly repeat things is annoying to the point that I can‚Äôt finish an episode. Please fix this."
Stop REPEATING yourself!,CelebrateEverything,01/02/2019,2 Stars,"I bought your book and very excited to learn more!  But listening to the podcast made me so crazy with how much you repeat yourself. I feel like so many people will respect more of what you say if you just say what you‚Äôre going to say one time. It will have a better impact. It sounds like you‚Äôre unsure, when you say it over and over. Just my two cents. I like what you‚Äôre saying, but it sounds like you‚Äôre talking to a toddler and I‚Äôm having a hard time receiving it."
Spot repeating please!!!,Anj.D,01/01/2019,2 Stars,"I really enjoy all the topics that he talks about but oh my gosh, it‚Äôs so hard to concentrate because he repeats himself so much. I‚Äôm sure someone has told him once or twice that he should stop repeating so please do us all a favor because we really want to hear you."
I Really Want to Listen But....,AshaMarsha,12/30/2018,3 Stars,The smacking and parsing of his lips and it sounds like foods in his mouth! I am sorry but I think he has good information so I will go and get his books but I cannot continue listening!
"‚ÄúMy‚Äù Celery Juice, on weight gain Podcast.",amore87,12/27/2018,3 Stars,"Before I state my observed curveball with MM; 

Let me just say I‚Äôve purchased 3 Books and I‚Äôve respected the knowledge, insight and the Healing behind them. 

On the recent weight gain podcast, he goes on to discredit new fad diets, Keto being one of them. I know several people that are doing Keto and u can‚Äôt assume that everyone‚Äôs Keto is the same. Some add Lean Fats and have lower fatty livers per their lab results. 
**I had a hard time admitting that MM didn‚Äôt credit them for being part of a Healthier Process in this Human Journey. 
** I had to admit that when he said ‚ÄúMy Celery Juice‚Äù he didn‚Äôt give Credit to his Spirit‚Äôs being. 

Somehow I feel Disappointed and Reminded that we all have Our Own Journey and Responsibility to Inquire and Question. It‚Äôs our Divine Right."
Healing,Mayra1920,12/23/2018,5 Stars,"If you want to heal read his BOOKS! he will not guide you on podcast, however they are still worth listening too. He‚Äôs amazing!!!! He has healed ALL my health issues. I am forever grateful from the bottom of my heart. SO GRATEFUL"

...,XC4621,12/21/2018,3 Stars,I appreciate the insight but I felt I was listening to a used car salesman‚Äôs pitch for half the time before he (finally) shared the useful info
All Anthony William podcasts are amazingly wonderful!,Albagotcha,12/10/2018,5 Stars,"Anthony William REPEATS what he says so that we will REMEMBER it, people! If you listen more carefully he explains that to us.
I love his podcasts! I can listen 24/7 ! 
Recently I purchased his Thyroid audiobook, but returned it after listening for an hour, because I could not understand what was being said because the narrators beautiful accent was toooooo heavy to ‚Äúhear‚Äù what was being taught. 
So, I found these podcasts - and I LOVE THIS!!!!"
Empty,Lynnie is my name,12/14/2018,1 Star,"I understand the psychology of repetition, however, The Medium says a whole lot with out really saying anything!! Scratching my head on this! ‚ÄúDrink celery juice! Drink it! You have to drink it! Whatever you do drink it!‚Äù And on and on for an hour!!! He never explains why! No scientific or nutritional info at all!!! Left me so empty and his delivery is awful :( I‚Äôm left with so many questions about his topics that had. I info to back them up :("
I Listen,watsuwoman,12/03/2018,5 Stars,"They say in order for something to be instilled in you, you have to repeat it 21 times then you will never forget it.  I know that‚Äôs how my brain works so I don‚Äôt mind Anthony repeating this important information.  It helps me learn!"
Love the message...,acumountain,12/10/2018,3 Stars,The person delivering it is painful to listen to... can‚Äôt listen anymore. The arrogance and annoying delivery sadly take away from what does make good health sense.
So many words!,Emarcum,12/07/2018,2 Stars,"Lord Almighty. I want to learn from this man, but my goodness does he just keep saying the same thing over and over. Literally Luke be a 15 minute podcast. I also feel like these podcasts are to dangle the solution in front of your face - that solution is buy his book(s)."
cystic acne,spiritualmermaid,11/30/2018,5 Stars,first time i found content that actually cured my cystic acne without antibiotics! i highly recommend his podcasts. yes he repeats himself but it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt know if this is your first time listening when you start his podcasts. try it out!!
Repetitive,SophiaFlood,12/03/2018,1 Star,Was really excited to listen to the content but it was too repetitive and he continues to unnecessarily reiterating that he is not being paid!  I gave up and will listen to a condensed version somewhere else.
Great Info!,Audrey Briz,11/27/2018,5 Stars,He genuinely cares and all of the info he passes along just makes sense!
Faulty and dangerous nutrition advice,clara225544,11/29/2018,1 Star,"The advice Anthony Williams gives in terms of diet is shockingly out of date and, if followed, will lead to poor health. His advocacy for low fat, a fear of fat, and animal fats is right in line with the standard American diet, which has contributed to the current chronic health epidemic we face. If you follow his advice you‚Äôll be hungry in the short term, and sick in the long term. Check out the work of the Weston A Price foundation if you want sound, time tested (and delicious!) food recommendations."
Thanks so much ! ‚ú®,DMBarbie,11/25/2018,5 Stars,When I became vegan I gained 30 pounds. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on. I‚Äôve learned so much from your book. I‚Äôll already lost 15 pounds and it was easy. Thanks so much. Have a peaceful day! üëºüèªüôåüèºüíû‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®üí´
Healing from hypothyroidism & hot flashes,karenkkj,11/24/2018,5 Stars,"I have done nothing but listen to this show for 4 months. I have learned so much about healing. If you are struggling with any health condition or know of a loved one who is suffering, you will want to listen to this show as much as possible. This is the information you need. Anthony is so passionate about helping you heal. His compassion is endless. Sure he goes on some rants but they are to help you learn. He has been helping people get better for a long time. Be patient. I have bee sick with hypothyroidism for 8+ years and finally feel great after eating the way he recommended. I am off all of my medications and I have only been doing this 4 months.

Life Changing,thegiodlife,11/24/2018,5 Stars,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Anthony William! I have been diligently drinking celery juice for just under two years, and it has definitely changed my life!  I am naturally healthy, but the benefits I have noticed in my body JUST from the celery juice alone, are amazing! Bloating is gone, regularity, I‚Äôm able to handle stress with without anxiety, more energy and mental clarity. I have just done the 28 day cleanse, and again, I am completely floored on how I feel! Anthony has changed my life and I am forever grateful for his life changing foods! I have listened to many of his podcasts over and over many times, and I do not mind any repetition of the life changing information. In fact, I think it reiterates the information to help  it ‚Äústick‚Äù because there is so much information to take in. I have ALL his books, and I use them all for reference and recipes. These are my bibles for health! Thanks Anthony for all you do to help others!!"
Yes,marytkp,11/21/2018,5 Stars,"Personally I like the repeating! The concept hit home, I take notes and it helps my brain when you come back around and say it again and sometimes in slightly different way! Thank you !"
Don‚Äôt waste your time,ars224,11/23/2018,1 Star,This guys talks about everything BUT the topic of the podcast. He dances around it while on skip.
Repeating himself,m19mbc,11/23/2018,1 Star,All he does is repeat himself and tell ppl to read his book. These podcasts are not constructive. He is venting about his critics.

I‚Äôve been stumbling through medical appointments for the last year ever since I was exposed to toxic mold. Last month I was diagnosed with a fatty liver.

You‚Äôre deceived by an evil demon,buggs1a,11/21/2018,1 Star,Your secrets about angels from 2010 is demonic. Angels are Gods servants. Not ours. Angels respond to the lord not us. You say you hear a real voice out loud and I believe that if true you‚Äôre being deceived by a demon.

"Lots of words, little information",EmiBriThomps,11/21/2018,3 Stars,"I would love to learn from Anthony but I have to wade through so much mush to get the info. Like the others have said, he repeats himself, says the same thing over and over.... ahhhh. Maybe he‚Äôs trying to entertain us, but it doesn‚Äôt work, just makes me loose interest. Please Anthony, just teach, there‚Äôs so much great information. If it‚Äôs the truth then keep it simple, you don‚Äôt need all the literation."
Recently purchased book,Intelligent or Lun?,11/21/2018,2 Stars,"I recently purchased his book, however after hearing the podcast I‚Äôm getting the sense that this individual is not scientifically sound. He is unable to explain the science behind his work, but rather spends his time repeating himself. Intelligent people know their information inside and out. They don‚Äôt need to repeat the same claim over and over."
Beware,Hello banana kong,11/20/2018,1 Star,"If you‚Äôre not knowledgeable about health and nutrition, seek a more reliable source. This isn‚Äôt it."

Difficult to listen to,AmilieD,11/14/2018,2 Stars,"He repeats himself so much that this could have been a twenty minute podcast, also the fifteen minutes of just listing conditions is too much."
Do yourself a favor - tune in,VorticeGirl,11/12/2018,5 Stars,"Only listen to these podcasts if you want to heal. Only listen if you want the truth. Only listen if you want to find the most exciting information of your life. I devour Anthony Williams‚Äô content. Have read every book, have listened to every radio show/podcast (over 100) and have been on his 28-day cleanse for over 10 months now. I began to see miraculous changes in my body from the second day. Yes, there is some repetition in his shows. He is teaching us to be our own expert and there are new people tuning into every show. That involves repetition. There are always new jewels and gems found in every show. You will always learn something new and benefit from investing your time listening. If you want to be a powerhouse of knowledge tune in. If you want to solve your health issues tune in. If you want to listen to a show that has you hanging on every word tune in. There is nothing more true or powerful than Spirit and Anthony William has a constant, direct line of communication. Do yourself a favor- tune in and join the revolution."
Good info told in long-winded and repetitive style,tacticalimagination,11/12/2018,2 Stars,Yes. Please stop repeating yourself as nauseum. I‚Äôve listened for 20 minutes and heard the same 2-3 simple concepts repeated 10 times each. Even short sentence fragments repeated over and over. I feel like I am wasting so much time hearing rambling and repetition. This could be a 5 minutes podcast and could deliver the same info so much more efficiently.
Medical Medium is the BEST!,Terrye B,11/10/2018,5 Stars,"Anthony William is the best!
Follow his recommendations and you will heal!
Keep doing everything you are doing!
We thank you over and over!"
Best Information Out There,Snookir,11/07/2018,5 Stars,"Anthony Williams‚Äô books and podcasts have helped me with so many issues, including a sick liver, gall stones, food sensitivities, arthritis, nerve pain, and recently a raging UTI. I suggest reading at least one of his books and trying his basic recommendations like avoiding ‚Äúno‚Äù foods, eating mostly plant based, and the heavy metal detox smoothie before making any harsh judgments like in some comments I‚Äôve read. He is a little slow getting to the point but his information is as good as gold. It is the safest healing regimen I have come across when taken slowly and consistently."
Refreshing,yay&23,11/05/2018,5 Stars,"After meeting and seeking doctors that told me to do things that I followed, nothing helped. I learned about Medical Medium and hAve been following his suggestions and Im much better.Yes, he is repetitive, but repetition helps some people learn better. Generally, it takes him 8-10 minutes to introduce himself which is repetitive so skim and gather the info you need. 

I dont think he is trying to sell his books. If he was, he wouldnt suggest to rent the book at the libraries. 

People who complain about his style of talking, listen to the content and dont judge the presentation. Maybe its not his strength. At least his suggestions are healing people that doctors have not healed yet. 

He is raw, authentic and informative."
Repeating!!,princetip,11/06/2018,3 Stars,"I agree with the previous review, Anthony goes on and on and on repeating the same words; it‚Äôs annoying & want to stop listening! Enough already!"
Right On,Tommy Bainbridge Island,11/05/2018,4 Stars,Love it Love It Love It
AMAZING,Salad4000,11/04/2018,5 Stars,If you truly want to heal listen to what Medical Medium has to say. He has been such an inspiration in my life and his knowledge and compassion for healing the body is absolutely AMAZING!
Miracle Healing Information That Works,david solomini,10/26/2018,5 Stars,"Over the years I have spent a tremendous amount of time and money working with many of the leading alternative doctors, and healers trying to heal a very rare condition called Lipodystrophy. Trust me when I tell you I am grateful to all of them, but no one has made such a profound impact on my health as Anthony William and the information he receives from Spirit. Until 36 years old I lived a life of seemingly perfect health and appearance. Then suddenly everything changed, almost overnight. One thing I have learned on my path is both mystery/rare illness and chronic illness are on the rise. Many leading experts attribute this to changes in our environment, food sources, connection with nature and increased stressors. In my experience it can be overwhelming and difficult to decipher what new protocol, diet, supplements, bio-hacks, and or procedures actually work. Each seeming to deliver results for a period of time and then... things get worse. Anthony William shares powerful information that actually works! It‚Äôs simple to implement, and the healing not only begins right away but keeps getting better and better. I must admit, another thing I like is Anthony sells NO products. All the supplements he recommends are from third party providers whom he gets NO kickbacks, payments or commissions from. His books he has for sale but eagerly suggests borrowing from a friend and or even the library. It‚Äôs rare to find someone who has real information that heals any condition you can think of, and works so tirelessly to give, help and serve others. Clearly you can tell I‚Äôm a believer and supporter. This comes from experiencing the healing I so desperately sought myself. Some people say he repeats himself too much... I‚Äôve been to many of the worlds leading doctors, and scientists. I‚Äôve taken loans and maxed out credit cards to work with them. Not only did they too repeat themselves often, and hand me off to their support staff, but what they offered only worked short term. I haven‚Äôt paid Anthony one single penny other than buying all of his books, and my healing began right away. I take his repeating himself as authentic passion and enthusiasm. He‚Äôs real, and cares deeply. Listening to his podcast not only gives me valuable information to apply to my healing but elevated my consciousness and feels like I have my coach right there with me. If you‚Äôre in need of healing a chronic illness, and tired of the let downs, Anthony William is the Godsend you‚Äôve been looking for!"
Repeating repeating repeating,T◊§L,11/01/2018,2 Stars,"I want to love this podcast because I think it would have a lot of good information i could use.. but, listening to my first one this morning I realized how much he repeats himself over and over. It‚Äôs like nails on a chalk board. I had to shut it off."
Can‚Äôt get enough!,Ebdmkgj,10/25/2018,5 Stars,"I LOVE this info and podcast! The information just resonates with my spirit and as I‚Äôve started to just implement some changes I have seen more improvement in my health than ANYTHING else! (And I‚Äôve tried a lot of things!) Listen to him, it‚Äôs amazing!!! I do agree that the podcasts could be shortened up without repeating, but I love Anthony‚Äôs care, compassion, and heart behind everything he shares and I can see that in some of the tangents he includes. I will keep listening until I have caught up on them all!!!"
Incredible Infirmation,ktwlks,10/09/2018,5 Stars,"The more I hear Anthony and read his books the more I believe that his word is the absolute truth. Everything he says just makes so much sense and aligns with what I‚Äôve experience in my body. Incredible information. Thank you for this work, Anthony."
Slooow,SharonNyc,10/22/2018,1 Star,A lot of talk... very slow to get to the point!!!
Repetitive and he sounds like a scammer,cmc_bk,10/20/2018,1 Star,"Although it appears that Anthony may be accredited and knowledgeable, his podcast is a WASTE OF TIME. He repeats himself over and over and fills the air with non-useful words and sentences."
"How to benefit from this podcast if you‚Äôre complaining about rambling, repetition, etc.",Minnelily,09/15/2018,5 Stars,"Skip the first 10 minutes because it takes him awhile to get to the topic. Really, the last 20-30 minutes generally holds the most practical advice (sorry, Dude!)
Set it to play faster (1.5 times = perfect)
Accept that Anthony is genuine, unscripted, passionate about his work, good-hearted, feels feelings, and has sort of a manic/ADHD delivery and therefore rambles and repeats himself a lot and goes on rants now and then. Just accept the malaprops, mixed metaphors, and imperfections as part of the charm and entertainment. 
Read at least one of his books. Buy, beg, borrow, or steal. His editor, designer, and publisher served him well and the info is efficient, fascinating, readable, organized, and truly worthwhile. 
Try to follow the money to test his motivation. I‚Äôm cynical and skeptical and always look for the angle. Anthony delivers on promises and works really hard, and I‚Äôm just not seeing a get-rich-quick pyramid scheme or advertising dollars beyond book sales (normal, typical) and live appearances (also normal‚Äîthe guy has to make a living). If this were a polished, big-money operation the production values of this podcast would be WAY slicker, he‚Äôd have monied sponsors, celebrity guests, a team of writers, and a high-buck editor/producer would cut all of the rambling and ranting. Anthony says ‚Äúcookie cutted‚Äù (yes, cutted) instead of ‚Äúsugar coated.‚Äù Clearly there‚Äôs no production budget. He‚Äôs not shilling trademarked products or subscriptions. It‚Äôs possible to get everything he offers completely free. None of his nutrition advice will harm you‚Äîeven if his message is pure bunk you can only improve your health by following it. (But Anthony, if you do get the opportunity to improve production values, I‚Äôd be cool with that! üòâ)
Actually try his advice- I did, my husband did, and results blew our minds. I stumbled across Anthony‚Äôs thyroid book after my doctor told me I‚Äôd need to start steroids. Decided to try some lifestyle changes before going down that road. Read a bunch of other thyroid stuff that didn‚Äôt seem to apply to me, but the issues and symptoms Anthony described really aligned with my complaints. So I decided to try Anthony‚Äôs three-month thyroid detox (more or less; I didn‚Äôt follow it perfectly but it was a radical change for me). Wow. Wow. Wow. My wonderful husband did it with me for moral support, and we just couldn‚Äôt believe how much better we felt, how much better we looked (constant compliments from our people about our trim figures), and how our brains cleared up. My eyeballs felt better, sleep got better, energy got better, digestion got better, everything got 100% better. I didn‚Äôt tell my husband that this program came from a medium‚Äîjust said I read it in a thyroid book. He‚Äôs so delighted with the results and his daily wild blueberry smoothie that he‚Äôs staying on the path. (And still doesn‚Äôt know it came from a medium!) Cheese & bread lover that I am, I reverted to standard American diet once my three months were up and as soon as I did, my hair started falling out.  Eyeballs got gummy and blurry again and had trouble reading computer screens again. Leg, arm, and back tingling again in a bad way. Brain fog came back, along with weight gain and puffiness. Headaches came back. Whether it‚Äôs Spirit, common sense, or voices in his head, Anthony‚Äôs advice is legit. I‚Äôm now getting back to celery juice and passing on the pepperoni pizza. Thanks for sharing your message, Anthony! Keep up the amazing work. Don‚Äôt let the haters hurt your feelings. Keep on being you and don‚Äôt cookie cut anything for us! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Get to the freakin‚Äô point already!,Moanish,10/05/2018,1 Star,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a strategy so people just get the books. He rambles on for ever, so the valuable information is really a small % of the time spent listening to the episodes. Too annoying. I‚Äôll read the books instead, goal accomplished üòÇ"
Nature Theraoy,Jenn Hodge,08/29/2018,5 Stars,"Anthony William has information that I have not found anywhere else.  This podcast was such an eye opener. It is an amazing piece of the puzzle to my healing. I have been following his Epstein Barr protocol and it‚Äôs the only thing that helped me heal from an old injury, the exhaustion and chronic pain I had been suffering with. Thank you so much for your dedication and knowledge. üíúüíúüíúüíú"
A Waste of Time,Moonatic,09/12/2018,1 Star,"I found absolutely nothing useful when I listened to his episode about IBS. The man seems to ramble and never made a point, not once explaining the condition or giving advice. Mostly seemed to complain about Western Medical treatments. That‚Äôs fine but offer some insights please. I‚Äôm sorry im being so harsh, here. Completely useless podcast and I have never had an issue with a podcast until now."
Very disappointed,hjjjkio,09/07/2018,1 Star,I came here for solid answers and all I got was ALOT of rant/ anger towards doctors and science in general. Just do your thing and leave them alone. It makes you sound very insecure as from where you get your knowledge. I truly listened to about 5 episodes for now and didn‚Äôt learn anything but ‚Äú drink celery juice‚Äù. Please try to stop the repetitive rant and just be more organized. The 55 min episode could become 15 min if you stop ranting and be more organized in your presentation.
Intrigued but disappointed and stuck on REPEAT,Nurse Yvonne,08/31/2018,1 Star,The content seems very intriguing. The podcast however has been a bit disappointing. MM repeats himself quite a bit. His presentation of the content isn‚Äôt organized well and he makes random comments that aren't relevant with the content he‚Äôs presenting. I jumped the gun and purchased his book before listening to the podcast. Hoping it‚Äôs formatted and organized better than this AND NOT AS REPETITIVE AS THIS.
An hour-long BS fortune cookie,&E;,08/29/2018,1 Star,"You'd think someone couldn't make this up, but, obviously someone did."
Anthony William‚Äôs is the real deal!,Naomi Ruth,08/16/2018,5 Stars,"My sister sent me Medical Medium, Life-Changing Foods and Thyroid Healing for my last birthday gift.  I really wasn‚Äôt very excited about the gift and was ready to glance through and shelve them.  But, I found I couldn‚Äôt put them down.  So interesting, packed with great information.    I have actually read all three books with many pages which are now marked up and have color stickers for quick reference to important information, and absolutely great tasting recipes which are so easy to follow.  Turns out to be my favorite birthday gift of all times that I‚Äôve ever received from my sister.   On waiting list for Liver Rescue.  Listened to all Anthony Podcast.  I hear his compassion and dedication to helping others.  I‚Äôve been drinking 16 oz celery juice for seven months and haven‚Äôt missed a day.   Also, daily green smoothie!  Lemon water daily.  Taking vitamins recommend by him on his site. Liquid Zinc, Bioactive B12 Blend.   My system is working better than ever!   I‚Äôve been gifting friends and relatives his books.  Most all are now on the Celery Juice regimen and it‚Äôs so simple but so helpful in so many ways.   Thank you Anthony for listening to Spirit and your willingness from such a young age by dedicating your life to helping so many.  I‚Äôm now blessed to be on that list.   Naomi D."
Not Helpful,LizzyWApple,08/27/2018,1 Star,I've listened to 2 of Anthony's podcasts today.  I was disappointed in that I didn't learn WHAT to do about the issue being dicsussed aside from drinking celery juice and eating bananas.   Anthony comes across as 'angry' vs. passionate ...   making it hard to listen to the material.   Sorry -- maybe I'll try listening to another episode on another day.
Bored,silverrose45,08/26/2018,1 Star,I want to listen but so bored.
I repeat...,Life id Bliss,08/17/2018,3 Stars,PLEASE PLEASE stop repeating yourself!  Please stop repeating yourself!  Please stop repeating yourself!  It‚Äôs literally driving me bonkers!  I want to tune in but OMG!  Please!
Anthony has healed my acne,skintruth,08/15/2018,5 Stars,"I‚Äôve had acne for 6+ years due to different diets and just being unaware of what acne is, thinking it was my hormones, thinking eggs were curing me, thinking high fat was the way to heal... ALL WRONG!!! Fruit heals, veggies heal, potatoes heal and I‚Äôm soooo passionate and thankful for finding Anthony!!!"
Best advise I ever heard!,vaseven,06/21/2018,5 Stars,"I have counted on Anthony for many of my health issues and he has offered the best advise over anyone. No one else has even come close to what he is telling us. Its a blessing to know the truth, finally! I get you Anthony and I am so grateful for all the work you have done. Thank you for sharing this valuable information! ü§ó‚ú®keep shinning the lightüôèüèªüåü"
Great but too repetitive,PElizabeth 1234,07/14/2018,2 Stars,The information is great but I really wish they would edit it down. The time could be cut in half is they cut out the repetitiveness.
Ask your doctor if voodoo is right for you.,slackario,03/18/2018,5 Stars,"As any Western medical expert can tell you diet has nothing to do with your health. At least that is what I was told recently by the top dermatologist in the state of Oregon.  My jaw dropped in disbelief as I looked at his assistants and prot√©g√©s who follow him around like scribes taking Pithy notes. 
If you‚Äôre sick and tired of being sick and tired then you need more exercise and you need to change your diet.  Your intuition has gone horse telling u that. Anthony Seems to have a direct line to thousands of years of accumulated human wisdom as it relates to your diet and how plants can heal.  This stuff is very bizarre but hallelujah for it!!"
Mind Blowingly Refreshing!,RCBannister,02/28/2018,5 Stars,"After spinning in circles for months for a healing process and being tossed and turned among the controversy from cause to ""allowed"" foods.... his confidence and knowledge is absolutely refreshing.  My search is over for the right path - thank you Anthony & Spirit!"
Waste of time,Memije24,03/17/2018,1 Star,"If like me you read a lot about alternative medicine and many modalities and are open to new points of view, this podcast still won‚Äôt really offer anything new to you.  I feel like this guy uses spirit as the entry point to his podcast which intrigued me, but there is nothing new to learn from his connection to spirit. He also hangs his shingle on this time when he was four and diagnosed his grandmother‚Äôs cancer. 

I listened to three episodes hoping he would figure out his pace and the balance of information. My conclusion is that this guy rants, throws out scare tactics, complains and somewhat whines for 85% and then offers some tips for 15% - all of which are not new.  He repeats and labors on the same point over and over again and it is exhausting. This podcast is one big commercial for his books, which I am guessing have the same information you have read in every other book.  Nothing new. And if you are new to all of this there are much better more informative and to the point productive podcasts out there. This one is very disappointing."
Changed my life,charmedlifelady,12/28/2017,5 Stars,Stunning information lovingly delivered. I am a new person as a result of this man‚Äôs work.
Anthony Williams is such an amazing teacher,Kellen jmsd 1998,04/10/2017,5 Stars,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I am so in board with all of your medical teachings. I am really working hard to learn your teachings. I know of dozens of people in my life that could so benefit. I just have to be careful that I don't try to ram this down their throat. Unfortunately most people seem more comfortable staying sick and connected to their doctor. But for the ones that are listening?  I'm so there. 

Thank you sir

Paul"
So much good info!,A_mm21,06/30/2017,3 Stars,Okay I love love love the podcasts and the books. So much valuable information. But please stop repeating the same sentence 3-5 times in a row in different formats. Please just get to the point!
Awesomeness!!,Duty cat,03/30/2017,5 Stars,He has changed my life. I feel so much better. Thank you Medical Medium
Nicolle,NMF-S,11/30/2016,5 Stars,"I love his passion and knowledge.  Everyone should take the time to listen to him and consider it an investment in thier life, wellbeing and health routines. Thanks MM!!"
You won't find this content anywhere else!,Lovingraw123,07/19/2016,5 Stars,"Anthony is years ahead of his time, the modern day Edgar Cayce. Unlike many in the health field, Anthony is funny and light-hearted, especially when talking about sensitive subjects such as disease and mystery illness. His information is revelatory and spot-on, and is helping transform the health of this world. And his book Medical Medium will change your life!"
